Excellent Movie
This is a great movie, I would recommend it to anyone. The writing is excellent, steering you through a crazy idea, and throughout the entire movie you're left wondering... is it real, or is he crazy? You get many hints both ways during the ride.

The movie explores the strained relationship between father and daughter, and theirs is an especially broken one. Evan Rachel Wood and Micheal Douglas both do an outstanding job with their characters, and are thoroughly convincing.

If you like low key Sundance-friendly movies that make you think, pick this one up.
