Really good, especially if you are a Muslim
As I am writing this review, few minutes have passed since I have watched Under the Shadow. I will not exaggerate like some other people do in praising this movie by calling it a masterpiece. It is not! If this is a masterpiece to you, you're setting the bar very low. But I have to admit that for a horror film, this thing is damn good and refreshing. Everything about this film works very well: the development of the story, the taut direction and especially the pacing. The movie is 1h24min which is the ideal run time since no time is wasted on unnecessary scenes or plot-lines. The thing I liked most beside the direction was the story, especially the involvement of Djinn. Since I am of the Muslim confession, it made me glad that somebody finally explored this theme in a movie. Basically Djinn are nothing else than demons and seen though I have seen a lot of demon-themed horror flicks, Under the Shadow gave me genuine sense of terror which is partly due to my small familiarity with the Djinn-theme. If you are a Muslim or you know a thing or two about the mythology of Djinn and how it affects the minds of lots of Muslims, you will understand how it managed to scare me. And before I forget to mention it, the subtext in this movie regarding the political and social situation in Iran is very well delivered. A lot of the difficulties that the main character faces are present to this day and it was really refreshing to see a movie that tackles such delicate themes without bashing your head in with political statements.If you are a fan of the conventional Hollywood horror film chances are you won't enjoy it much. But if you like seeing foreign films that swerve from conventions you will probably like it.
