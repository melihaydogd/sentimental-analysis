Oh. My. God.
How this movie received solid reviews from critics is beyond me. It's predictable, and poorly executed. The motives that sway the character's decisions are flimsy at best, laughable in truth. The ending is awful, the writing is poor and mundane. I'm honestly flabbergasted. Honestly, I'm giving it a one because someone needs to balance out the fact that anyone would give this a 6+ review.
