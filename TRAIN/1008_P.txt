An interesting and visually compelling thriller/horror with great atmosphere
Call me crazy, but I really enjoyed it.

I thought the atmosphere was very well crafted - taking a lot of inspiration from David Lynch/Twin Peaks(check out the alternate opening on the DVD and tell me that it doesn't remind you of the Twin Peaks opening credits sequence), but still managing to be interesting and effectively creepy. The music was also great and very Angelo Badalamenti-ish.

Some reviews categorized it as part of the Torture Porn sub-genre, but I disagree, I think the gore wasn't too gratuitous. Whenever there was gore it was effective, it wasn't overused to the point where the audience becomes apathetic to it.

I especially liked the art direction, and overall I think it was very aesthetically pleasing. Some interesting surreal imagery. Yes, the color symbolism was overdone, but what can I do, all those lush blues and reds appealed to me.

I also thought the script was clever in its "plants" & "pay-offs" and in terms of foreshadowing. And Lindsay Lohan's acting, though not brilliant, was adequate and convincing.

The directing in some of the dramatic dialogue scenes could have been tighter, with a bigger sense of urgency, especially towards the end, but I will be interested to see what director Chris Sivertson does next.
