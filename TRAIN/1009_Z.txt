Dead pool...Violence
Is this a super hero movie? Well yes in a way that Deadpool cannot be killed. Is this meant for kids? No. It is more violent with adult scenes and nasty jokes. For Super hero movie it more of super vengeance movie of a character taken from the movie "Good,Bad and Ugly" having the traits of all the three. X-men are comedians and Deadpool is originally a human. If I were to give a presentation of the movie it will end in three slides. Slide 1 introduction, Slide 2 Romance and Terminal Disease, Slide 3 Betrayal and vengeance. But then presentation of this movie is very good. With little content they made a good movie. For me a movie should have more content with good presentation of course. I wont call this movie as bad but the expectation after seeing the trailers were very higher. In the end trailers alone was enough for this movie. If you have seen all the trailers then you don't require to see the movie to spoil your imaginations as there is nothing more impressive to it.
