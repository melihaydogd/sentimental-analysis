Surprisingly enjoyable
While there are hundreds and thousands of movies out there about fast cars and hot-headed drivers who were once scorned and then got out for revenge, this movie... oh, wait, actually, this is another one of those.

Still, I picked to watch it simply because who doesn't like fast cars and hot guys in that order? Please do note I am female, at this point. I am also a huge fan of NFS video games, so I decided not to miss the movie, even though I was not expecting much.

That said, you will not find an amazing or puzzling plot, it is pretty much linear and very predictable. The characters are also not that well developed and do not tend to stick in your mind long after movie. All in all, it gives you nothing of value except two good hours of great visuals, beautiful cars you can only ogle at in movies or games, amazing action sequences and some pretty nasty car stunts, though, sadly, not too much of those. Still, I did find myself enjoying those few hours quite a lot, despite the plot full of holes and the totally needless sappy romance thrown in for good measure.

So, if you can turn a blind eye to the lack of plot and are a fan of NFS, sleek cars, street racing and crazy velocity, you will find this movie pretty satisfying. If not, well, it will most probably be the longest two hours of your life.
