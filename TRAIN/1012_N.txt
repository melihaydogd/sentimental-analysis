Her What? Who's that Girl?
It's rare I award a film 10/10 stars - even for many films I truly love. Equally, it's uncommon for me to give a movie just one star out of ten...but, here we are. I literally just watched this, took a nap and I barely remember a single thing about it. Except, well, I didn't like it at all and if I had a gun to my head, I wouldn't be able to give a synopsis. THAT is NOT a good sign, so hence: the 1 star. Bah!
