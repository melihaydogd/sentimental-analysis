Not My Favorite One
"I enjoyed the music that they choose and how they put the music on but i am not enjoyed the story, the dialogue are weird, and i know lot's of people fascinate the art that they make here but i think it just too weird, kinda boring, the voice acting it's so flat and i'm still questioning why the voice acting it's not The Beatles theyself, not completely bad but not my favorite one"
