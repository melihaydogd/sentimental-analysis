A gritty action flick!
What more can be said of a movie directed by Sam Peckinpah? Blood...guts...guns...bad guys...pretty dames...a love story...piles and piles of cash. Yes sir, "The Getaway" is a fantastic action movie.  And it's got the best film star of them all -- Steve McQueen. Don't get me wrong. This film isn't just a lot of shooting and killing.  It's got a story.  And it's got characters.  (Two things you don't get much of these days.)   So don't bother renting that tepid remake they did a few years ago...see the original and the best!
