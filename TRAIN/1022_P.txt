If you really love the Simpsons, then you have to love this movie.
No doubt, this movie is as good as the TV show. There is an excellent story, which is entertaining in every single moment. The film focuses on the family Simpson, so you might miss some of you favorite characters like Sideshow Bob, Apu or Mr. Burns. But this really doesn't matter, because you can see these characters in the show and it is not necessary, that they appear a lot in the movie. Instead there are some new characters, for example the president Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is very funny. There is also a nice cameo of a very big star, which is very surprising.

Every joke makes you laugh. There are excellent quotes and great moments. Dan Castellanata does a very good job again. Homer is as funny as in the show.

The Simpsons Movie might be the funniest animation movie ever made. You can laugh the whole film through. For Simpsons Fan it will be the best of all feelings to watch this movie.
