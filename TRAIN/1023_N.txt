One of the worst movies I have seen
This film was an unfortunate waste of time and money. As an English teacher that teaches the classics, including The Count of Monte Cristo,I was amazed to find few similarities between the novel and this film, and these similarities were questionable at best. The vengeful plot of the Count is a beautifully woven, romanticized, psychological, thriller. After Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned on the Ch√¢teau d'If, he plans to take vengeance on the men who were responsible for destroying his life. These men were Danglars, Villefort,and Fernand--who was not a friend of Dantes, but the man who took away his love. Because of these men Dantes lost everything that was dear to him, including the women he loved, Mercedes--who was not pregnant by Dantes and who waited 18 months before she married her cousin. It was from the pressure of prison that Dantes carefully calculated the methods he would use to get his revenge. He wanted it to be a slow and painful suffering--because a quick death was too good for these men. None of this tension is evident in the film. The film bastardized a novel that was full of tension and suspense, which keeps readers wanting to find out what happens next. This was Hollywoods way of chasing the almighty buck. This film did little to make me or my students want to watch it. My juniors and seniors, who are not always focused on reading, are thoroughly engaged in the novel because of Dumas' masterful writing. Several students have seen the film and have made the same comment I have made--this is film for people who have never read the book. So, stay out of the video store, save your money, grab the book out of the library,sit down and let Alexandre Dumas take you on a thrilling adventure that will keep you turning the pages.
