Not my cup of tea
After watching the entire box set of breaking bad recently, this film was a punt for me. Unlike BB, character development appears rushed and skittish. I understand there is a fandom of the actors from BB but this excuse of a film is just lame.

The vagueness of the protagonist's back story didn't help me click into the movie at all. Instead it left me with thoughts of how hard it must be for Bob Odenkirk to shake off the character of Saul in BB. If someone else had played Hutch maybe it would be slightly more believable but alas we'll never know.

In all though it's not a great story and relies too heavily on Hutch's incredible combat skills and the extraordinary incompetence of the antagonist and his associates. Hence the low score.
