I love movie musicals but HATED this
I was sooo excited for this to movie to finally hit Netflix and even paused the movie after the opening number just to tell my boyfriend that I was sure I was going to love it. Maybe my expectations were set too high, but overall the movie was huge disappointment. The dancing is very stiff, which I first thought was endearing and part of their characters, until I noticed there was no positive progression. The Sebastian storyline with Jazz references was not so much offensive (at least not to me), but just not believable. The musical numbers didn't add much to the storyline. I didn't get invested into the character's background or development. The only thing I liked was that the story seemed to be about young lovers letting each other go in order to fulfill their individual dreams, but that could have been portrayed better. I'm honestly not sure why his movie is rated this high, except for one catchy song.
