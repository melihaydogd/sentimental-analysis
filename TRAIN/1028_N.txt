I want those 2 hours of my life back.
This was one of the worst movies that I've seen in years. I like action movies and usually have no problem with mindless plots and violence but this movie made Steven Seagal movies look Oscar worthy. The actors were fine and there were plenty of funny one liners. The plot was nothing special but I can accept that. The problem was that the movie was carried out with such a lack of cohesion that everything just fell to crap. I just did not give a damn what happened in the movie after the first 30 minutes and to tell the truth I just wanted it to end. My advice is to save your money and more importantly to save your time. Remember this is your life and you can never get those hours back.
