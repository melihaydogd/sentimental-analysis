Too realistic to arise some interest
I have just watched the film, and I have the impression that this film do not deserve to be in the top 250 movies. I think it is a good and realistic portrait of Adolf Hitler's last days, and all the madness that surrounded him. I utterly disagree with those who say this film gives a pro-Nazi vision. I have paid much attention more than two hours and I haven't found the slightest sign of Nazi Propaganda in this film. But I was willing to watch a film and what I found was a documentary. And I am not happy with that. The film didn't arose my interest at most points. Why? Mainly because it is too long, it's more of a documentary than a film, and doesn't add any interesting special feature to make it more interesting. I particularly don't feel any suspense during the film. What I am trying to say is that when you are doing a film about something people already know (most people know a lot about Hitler and particularly that he committed suicide)you have to add something to the film to make it interesting, or to add your personal view to an historical event. And none of these things have been done in the present film. Therefore, I see this film more as a boring documentary than as a film.
