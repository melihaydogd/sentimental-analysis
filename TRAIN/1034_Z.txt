A work of genius showing its age.
Metropolis is a troublesome film for me. I appreciate its vision, the intricacies and prescience of its social commentary, and the sheer beauty of some of its scenes. The robot is an icon for retro-futurist design. A film impossible not to admire. Yet each time I have seen it -- four now I think -- I always find myself bored. The visionary sequences are too few and the melodrama grows too heavy far too often. Scenes like Maria's flight from Rotwang become overwrought at once and then drag on long enough to be comical. My most recent viewing was the Hollywood Classics DvD. With so many restored versions of Metropolis around, the quality of this release was terribly disappointing. I love silent German film, but each time I have seen Metropolis, I come away feeling it is an over-rated film.
