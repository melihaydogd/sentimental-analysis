Horrible
This movie completely over rated don't get me wrong the acting is superb but it's the storyline which angers me. This movie favors the Americans way too much. I mean during the duration of this movie all you is is American soldiers and Germans. It makes it look as if the Americans were the only ones fighting the war.My question is where are the British the Canadians and the other various nations that were fighting this war long before the Americans entered. This movie's storyline is completely ridiculous the American Army would not spend that much time looking for one private they have bigger and better things to do.For historical accuracy it 5.5 although the props and costumes and terminology is accurate the entrance where the soldiers are scrambling for safety isn't Americans did have air support but the American pilots were so bad at math the miscalculated and hit there own men.I think this movie is a load of American loving bull and a real WWII movie should covers all the perspectives of EVERY nation not just one. Especially not the one that came in at the last minute.I say this as a Canadian JTF2 corporal.
