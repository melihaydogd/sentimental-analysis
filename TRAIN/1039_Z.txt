8.6 - Really?
How in the world could this get 8.6 out of 10.0 from so many people? This movie was uneventful and rather depressing.The story of a man whose life is filled with tragedy and becomes a grouch does not do much for me.The boy with a father who is never around. Wow, just what I want my kids to see.Maybe I missed the point of the movie. That said, even my kids age 10 & 12 thought it was boring. We went with 2 other kids who said it was OK but nothing special. I would give the visual high marks but the story is lacking IMO.
