Misleading Marketing actually makes this worse
Ok first off, the link to Denzel's 2 Guns is non existent.Second despite the cover, Adkins is in this film for about 15 minutes.Without the false pretenses caused by the marketing department, this movie could be a 4 or even a 5. It's ok, not great, but ok. The 2 actual leads are watchable.
BUT because you come into this expecting something else it never really gets a chance.
You end up feeling robbed!
