What a load of nothing
Unbelievably boring and mundane movie apart from last 10 minutes. Me and the missus are huge QT fans but this and the Hateful 8 were just slow burn self indulgent ego rubs. Given the budget and the cast my 12 year Old niece could have made a better film!
But I bet they all had a jolly old time making it...
4 stars for the 60s vibe and that's the best I can say.
