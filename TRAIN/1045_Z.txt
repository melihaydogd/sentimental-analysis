Great acting, too little horror.
This is a surprising little movie, in that it has Oscar worthy acting and a great script in what is suppose to be a horror movie. Keegan Connor Tracy is outstanding as the mother of a young boy with an imaginary friend, but everyone is excellent in the cast. Stephen McHattie is always good , although his part is tiny.
Other then the acting, what amazed me is that characters behaved exactly as you would expect someone to behave in real life, it's obvious an actual adult wrote the script. The problem is, it is suppose to be a horror movie, and there just wasn't enough horror to it, plenty of atmosphere, a sense of dread, the correct dark tones to the plot and a few shocking occurrences , but the movie was as much drama as it was horror. The plot needed to be expanded and fleshed out. Still it was interesting and is worth a watch.
