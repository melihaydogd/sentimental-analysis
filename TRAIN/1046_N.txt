Predictable and unoriginal
I'm so disappointed. I actually can't believe they are passing this off as a worthy marvel series in its on right. There is nothing new or original in the storyline. It's laughably predictable it's almost offensive. The action sequences are great. But as you would expect. Everything else is paltry. There is no nuance or subtlety. It's all screaming in your face realism. It's for kids and certainly not what I wanted from a marvel series. Devastated.
