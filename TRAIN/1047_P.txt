"A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having."
Exquisite, passionate action-romance-melodrama from screenwriters Larry and Andy Wachowski has the U.K. under martial law and a fascist regime in the 2020s. Working girl Natalie Portman (in a charming performance without too much Sturm und Drang) chances to meet a masked vigilante named V after he rescues her from thugs; turns out his hit list is full of government officials, and she is asked to comply with V and be his accomplice. Despite some confusion in the latter portion of the plot (as well as an unnecessary recap of visual highlights, as if from a TV mini-series), the film is slick and smooth, easily consumed, and often very exciting. Director James McTeigue carries us through the nastier elements of the plot without dwelling on the excesses (this isn't "RoboCop"), and Portman and masked Hugo Weaving are a scintillating pair. Brilliantly designed and photographed, with amusing soundtrack choices and a satisfying finale.
