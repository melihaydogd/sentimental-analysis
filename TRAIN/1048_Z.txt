great acting does not outweigh gratuitous violence
A well done film about some pretty twisted characters. The setting is the old West. The characters are the gritty cowboy / settler types and the hangers on. The quality of the acting and direction are evident in the clear stereotypes portrayed. Even the minor characters like the saloon owner, the madaam and the innocent villain are portrayed with exceptional clarity.The problem I have with the movie is it is difficult to watch. Murders, beatings, cruelty, callousness - a cesspool of human dysfunction - are exquisitely crafted.If you are inspired by the art and insulated from the emotional content - go for it. If you watch films to learn something or feel better when the movie is over then forget it.
