This is a tale that's heart wrenching for any sensitive human.

Something terrible happens and the King Kong dies. But I wished so much each time I watched that may he not die. It's a real tough task to be sitting through a long emphatic and hugely opulent climax. Each time I saw this movie, I felt against the tragedy of King Kong and wish we had more beasts like King Kong which are humane to scare off these inhuman beings.

King Kong seems to be more compassionate than many humans. But, Alas! this is a film and King Kong is an animated character. It goes to supreme extents for his love that are humanly impossible. Be it fighting with a dinosaur or holding the girl tenderly so that she does not get hurt in the epic climax fight done on the Empire Estate building.

Peter Jackson who adapted LORD OF THE RINGS magnificently, remade this 1930s classic of King Kong. He did it so very wonderfully that the technology was aptly used to make this film enthralling, spine-chilling and tear-jerking.

Naomi Watts played as Ann Darrow, the vulnerable love of King Kong. She showed fear and compassion beautifully. Jack Black was very good and so was Adrien Brody. But it's the monster King Kong whose performance that has, the thumping of the chest, the growling in the air, jumping on the cliffs, falling from the tower is what makes this a wonderful film. It's hard to forget this film long after we have seen. I just saw it again and I am left with the same feeling, as I did when I saw it the first time.

Peter Jackson remade a masterpiece into a better one, by using technology. The fight with dinosaur is just one heck of it that is loved. I am happy that I have the Blu-Ray. It's a 4/5 for a movie that I wish to see in IMAX one day. It deserves a big screen viewing.
