Watched it too many times
I used to love this movie, but after watching it over and over again I found too many inconsistencies through out the movie.   The acting is awesome but the direction of the movie is lacking. The script was a great idea, but through out the movie I think some one was smoking too much weed. It seems to be an A.D.D. movie where the director can't focus on any thing for more than two minutes.  Yes, there are a collection of wonderful scenes in the movie and the actors all did a fantastic job, but I just can't stand the movie any more. I constantly find myself watching to reach through the screen and tell the actor, "no no no, your character wouldn't do that..."  My two favorite scenes are "the gold watch" and "the syringe".  Christopher Walken is a god.  Directing 0 Script .5 Acting 1 Originality 1 Soundtrack 1 Continuity (-1) Christopher Walken 5  7.5 of 7
