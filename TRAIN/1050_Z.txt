It is an interesting but confusing movie
It has an extreme stylized look but at the end you leave wondering: what did I just watch? There has to be something more? So, I went and got the book Under the Skin by Michael Faber who is rightly compared to Kafka:http://www.amazon.com/Under-Skin-Novel-Michel-Faber/dp/0156011603and the book fills in all the movie holes and more. The book is wonderful and after reading the book you realize that the movie is like a neutered Vodsel ... if you have read the book you will understand what I mean.That said I would encourage watching the film and then reading the book because if you change the order of consumption you will be ushered out of the theater by armed guards.--Thom
