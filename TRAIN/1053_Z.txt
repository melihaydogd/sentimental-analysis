it is what it is
The remake of Garry Marshall's "Overboard" is one of the silliest movies that I've seen. And it doesn't pretend to be anything else. The purpose is to show Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez getting into all sorts of awkward situations. It's not any sort of masterpiece but isn't supposed to be. If anything is to get taken from the movie, it's that Anna Faris is a hot babe (her ponytail looks great on her), Eugenio Derbez is a handsome dude (I like how he still has chest hairs), and oligarchic families are among the creepiest people out there (Derbez's character's family could just as easily be the Kochs, Mercers or Waltons).Fun, if over-the-top.
