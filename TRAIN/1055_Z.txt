Mesmerizing moments in a giant void.
Under my Skin has some of the most imaginative and evocative sound design and scoring that I have ever seen in a 21st century film. There is some equally surreal and eerie visual in the picture as well...but there is no picture.Whatever story they were trying to adapt from the novel source material, was clearly written as first person thought, feelings and contemplation, because dialogue and charter interaction is virtually non-existent. the supposedly extra terrestrial Scarlett Johanseen depicts is almost as devoid of live as a mannequin. She is an unreadable character.Those who get off David Lynch, and other practitioners of sexually-infused surrealism might find some pleasure in Under the Skin. All I got was the feeling of a potentially intimate story lost in the translation.
