Pathetic
While it did spawn a nifty couple of sequels, the original Star Wars sucked. The rebels, so willing to die for a cause, seemed awful selfish in not wanting to sacrifice themselves to save the others.  How many ships did Vader blow up while in the narrow tunnels?  He'd pick off groups of three at a time, and each one would sit there and say, "Oh no, he's locking on.  I'm being killed!" None of them seemed to be willing to slam on the breaks and smash themselves into Darth's ship, killing the villain and saving the day in one move.  Give me a break.
