Somehow, I'd missed "Interstellar" up to this point, so with the cinemas in the UK tentatively reopening after Covid shutdown, we decided that the IMAX presentation of the film would be a good way to ease ourselves back in to going. Whereas I had some issues with the film, as an IMAX presentation it was certainly an experience.

Set in the near future, where a blight is systematically destroying all the crops of the Earth. The remnants of NASA launch a spaceship on a multiyear mission to investigate whether any planets on the other side of a newly appeared wormhole are suitable for human life. This ships designated pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) must decide whether to sacrifice time with his children in the hope of saving the human race.

You can't argue that "Interstellar" isn't good. It is top notch in every aspect of filmmaking. The visual effects, the score, the performances are all spellbinding. This is one of history's greatest directors bring us his version of "2001: A Space Odyssey" - with all the layers, expressionism and concepts that the inspiration has. It also operates as Nolan's love letter to his daughter, about the time he sacrifices away from her to make his movies and how he feels about that. It is a masterpiece.

All that said, I didn't love it. Not the way I have done other films, not in the way I have done other Nolan films - and I'm hard pressed to explain exactly why that is. I feel . . detached from it, somehow, maybe there's slightly too much going on? Maybe it's a little contrived at the end? Maybe it's a little too similar to "Contact" as well as "2001"? I'm not sure. I can see the brilliance of it all, but it's something I appreciate rather than adore.
