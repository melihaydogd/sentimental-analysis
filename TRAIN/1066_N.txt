Get Ready For One Of The Most Callous & Black-Hearted Stories Ever Told!
While patiently sitting through this reeking heap of modern-day stench, slime and grease, the following 3 questions (as well as others) came readily to mind -

(1) Was I really supposed to like this sleazy, low-life, bastard-of-a-character named Lou Bloom? Was I really!?.... If I was supposed to like this turd, it sure would've helped me to see something of value in this rotten, little film.

(2) Why did the crimes and disasters that Bloom was so gung-ho about filming only happen at night? Eh? Why?.... Surely people got murdered and had car crashes during the day, as well.

(3) After viewing Nightcrawler from start to finish - Was I at all surprised to find out that, sure enough, actor Jake Gyllenhaal also co-produced this $8.5 million production, too?

I mean, once I knew this little, all-important tidbit of info, it explained everything to me as to why Nightcrawler was so sickening and over-the-top as it gleefully celebrated the success of one of the most despicable, all-time losers imaginable.

And, yes, I thought that Gyllenhaal fit the role of Lou Bloom (a total blood-sucking leech having a feeding frenzy on the underbelly of society) to absolute perfection.
