there was no thriller, suspense or punch
Great cast...unbelievable really when you think of it. But somehow they managed to make them all appear mediocre. It was just okay. For a budget of $70million and building on the precipices of the first movie , i expected more action, more heart thundering moments....but it really felt short. I kept waiting for that gaspy moment...until the credits started rolling....I have never watched a movie where the heist was more easier.. this is supposed to be a thriller but it felt more like a comedy...James Corden i love but he was totally lost in that character...They didnt need Mindy K either...goodness.....whoever wrote this script didnt do a good job
