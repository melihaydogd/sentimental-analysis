This film has become a symbol for all free men
This film has become a symbol for all free men in the Arabic countries, I think it affected the Arabs more than the West, Egypt likes young people wearing this mask does not know that they were fully insured, once wrote a news website HTTP://Iraqi-website.com/ story guy wearing this mask for fun police had arrested and imprisoned for three years and he's locked up yet. Maybe the revolutions were not created for the weak, but I like this movie because he found me a fantasy I liked to live in it, perhaps state fair and the distribution of wealth but nice fantasy fiction, I watched the movie 5 times and each time I discover I forgot certain detail, hoping to produce again with a new vision might include Arab revolutions and violent religious extremism
