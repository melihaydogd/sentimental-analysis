I can't believe this nonsense (Spoilers)
I'm a fan, I stopped reading the manga so I wouldn't be spoiled watching the anim√©. I was very disappointed after it was all over. It was like they cut and pasted fairy tail episodes to make this movie. Hear what the post credit scenes was better than the entire movie. So skip to that you won't be missing anything special. What a waste of 1hr 25minutes.
