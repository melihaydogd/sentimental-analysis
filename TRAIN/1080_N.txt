Who Paid off the Critics??
This is not a good movie by any measure whatsoever. The popularity of reality TV has obviously spilled onto the big screen. Lets get the the good stuff out of the way. The acting is pretty good and the 12 year span of the story in which they had to perform was a novel and courageous accomplishment in spite of the glaring casting errors that were not evident until the kids stated to mature. That's it ! There is no plot, just a series of vignettes all without ending, a most frustrating feature of this epic. The first hour has to rank as one of the most boring in movie history. A moody little boy and his perky sister interacting very slowly and painfully in totally uninteresting little episodes of nothing but everyday boring life but with no endings to the episodes. Just as your interest is piqued - as in the vignette where the now teenager is punished by his photography teacher for not completing assignments. The boy hates football, so the teacher assigns him a weekend football game photo project comprising 300 shots, all to be categorized, developed and presented the following Monday morning. We see him shooting the game, the crowd the cheerleaders et al and, as with all of these little vignettes, are drawn in to the story. But once again, NO BLOODY ENDING ! We never find out what happens on Monday, instead we are transported a few years into the future for another never-ending vignette. If you like reality TV,then perhaps you are conditioned to this sort of pointless, plot less tripe. If not, go and watch this anyway, just so you can enhance your appreciation of real movies with plots.
