Top #250? I must be out of the loop.
I rated this show a 2.  Why?  To me, this show was a senseless glorification of drugs and violence.  When seeing it in the theatre, my wife and I walked out and demanded our money back.  I've never seen the full movie...I couldn't stand it.  I've even rented it again, thinking I must have missed something...but turned it off 3/4 of the way through, thoroughly disgusted.  Why was this movie rated so highly?  I think it is a sign of our times. Drugs are everywhere, and violence sells.  Rather pathetic, but true.  Says something about the decadence of our society.  Are we at the end of another Roman Empire?  Is it all downhill from here?
