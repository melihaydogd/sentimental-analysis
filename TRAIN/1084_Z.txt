Classic
Stephen Frears and Steve Coogan succeeded in integrating to a poignant drama a good dose of humour and this mix of genres is really the strong point of the movie. You surprise yourself laughing, during serious scenes, at the spicy remarks of the endearing Philomena, embodied by a flawless Judi Dench.  Unfortunately, the scenario still remains very linear and though the story itself is moving and the stakes high, the movie seems to lack a real dramatic dimension, you never feel emotionally involved in this tragic but also predictable quest.  All in all, you can't say Philomena is a bad movie, but it suffers from a certain classicism inevitably prejudicial.
