Terrible. Who makes a Yugioh movie without the voice actor?
I give this movie a 1 because well, the writing is terrible compared to the original series. Secondly, the movie teases you all 2 hours long that Atem (Yami Yugi) will return, but you never hear him speak. There's only still shots that show him but he never speaks and it's a cheap way to cash in on die-hard fans. Secondly, all the characters are one dimensional and serve no purpose. Kibas action in the movie at the end makes no sense at all. I hope my review doesn't spoil anything but if you are going to watch a Yugioh movie, it's only fair that you know you won't get to hear the main voice actor that made the series the success that it was.
