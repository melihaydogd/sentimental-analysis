Sad, sad movie
I was hoping for better out of this movie. The special effects were decent, but the story-line blew. It seemed just to ramble along without going much of anywhere. I think it could have used some major work. A little more back-story wouldn't have hurt any. It reminded me of a bad episode of Charmed or Buffy. Willow did the whole black eyed with dark power long before this and it was more entertaining then. The Book of Damnation? I guess they couldn't get hold of the Halliwell Book of Shadows. Too bad, it at least has color illustrations and appears to be a more informative read. The whole thing seemed thrown together. Too bad, because the potential for a good movie was there.
