Sweet -N- Offensive
Well, um, I'm not sure what to say about "The Nutty Professor". I have heard a few parodies on this movie and some have said this is a decent comedy. But for the most part, this movie broke my heart because I used to be over weight and recently dropped all the pounds, so I felt for Sherman. But I felt that the movie really over did it on the fat jokes because I know some people that exercise and do whatever they can to loose weight and it's almost impossible. So I felt that in some ways this movie was cruel and unrealistic. But it had a very sweet side and it had it's occasional jokes that could get a little laugh. So, I'd recommend over all, but then again, if you are very touchy on weight jokes, you might want to skip.
