The story doesn't add up - a 2 hour waste of time
The story tries to throw too many things together that just don't come together to make a logical story.

Ben Affleck plays an autistic savant hero. He maintains an inexpressive face - that is autism. The autism angle is interesting and but then pair that with a super efficient killing machine doesn't work. The good supporting cast are wasted.

There were so many illogical plot turns that I gave up caring that it didn't gel in the end. If he was betraying the bad guys like the cartel and the mob to the treasury won't they become suspicious after a while that something bad would happen after he did their books. The father's death was illogical. Who kills someone for crashing a funeral? But even worse was the climax shoot out. It was so ludicrous and laughable unless it was supposed to be a comedy suddenly. How did his family end up on different sides and he didn't seem too upset his brother was for the bad guys. I don't know what the treasury were congratulating themselves for at the end. They didn't do much.

The slow moments weren't used to bring the story together. Worst plot of a movie in years.
