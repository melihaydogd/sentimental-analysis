A very bold early sound film
This is one of the key early talkies. Fritz Lang had already proved in the silent era that he was a master of visual story-telling with the likes of Metropolis. In M he combined this visual brilliance with some of the most inventive use of sound in the early days of the technology. The former is typified by rightfully famous scenes such as the murder of the little girl which is alluded to with four simple shots of an empty chair, an empty stair-well, a little ball rolling out from the bushes and a balloon caught high up in the telephone wires - in this way Lang was able to depict the most heinous of crimes imaginable in the most restrained, but nevertheless disturbing, way; sound is added to the mix in a similar creepy manner with the killers whistling being used as a clear indicator of his ominous presence.

The film also takes an unusually complex view of the aftermath of the killer's capture. Most films would have depicted the murderer as an irredeemable monster and had clear moral certainties about his fate. I can't say I personally disagree with this approach in the case of a serial child killer to be perfectly honest, however, in M society is called into question in their desire for swift punishment for the killer. Its certainly a commendably complex approach to the subject, even if it is extremely difficult having any sympathy with the man we the audience know perfectly well is the child murderer.

Without doubt this is a very important movie. I can't say I love it though, as I did feel it dragged somewhat in the middle section. Peter Lorre's absence from the screen for most of the running time isn't perhaps a good thing either. But in terms of bold approach both stylistically and thematically, this film certainly delivers the goods.
