Boring. That's what it is. Just plain boring. It doesn't deserve the hype it gets. I've seen the movie twice and was bored both times... and I really wanted to like it because all of my friends did. The acting might be okay. But I felt nothing for any of the characters or the story. As someone who, again, gave even the likes of Troll 2 five stars, the fact that I was more invested in a bad movie's story than this supposed "good movie" is really saying something. It's a total snoozefest. I honestly didn't find a single scene interesting. Even the Doctor Who knockoff "The Curse of the Black Spot" was more entertaining with better characters and a good story. No thanks. So that's my synopsis, I barely remember what happens but I don't really care. I didn't like it at all.
