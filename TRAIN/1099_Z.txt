Another 'Chick Flick'
I can forgive Diane Lane just about anything, even choosing to appear in this painfully fake Romance Movie. Without even knowing who wrote or directed it, I could tell that they had to be women - not because it's so bad but because its fantasies are redolent of that most odious of genres - romance fiction. But the most obvious giveaway that we have stumbled into a "chick flick" is the appearance of that laughably silly Englishwoman like some Ghost of Orgies Past, who spouts unprovoked platitudes about hedonism everywhere she goes, always uninvited.But Tuscany is lovely and dear Diane does the best she can with her papier-mache role, so this trip wasn't a total loss after all.
