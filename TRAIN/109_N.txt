Chuckled 2 or 3 times; Not even worth renting
I was taken completely by surprise moments ago upon discovering that the current average rating for this movie was 7.3. I might have chuckled twice the entire movie; an episode of almost any current sitcom would yield more laughs in its half-hour (and would cost much less, too)! It was so bad that I commented to my wife that the movie needed a laugh track (maybe I'm watching too much TV...). I am so disappointed with this movie that I'm sending a photocopy of my ticket stub to New Line Cinema to ask for a refund. Will Farrell was trying, but he had little to work with; the entire production was simply too weak (point: studios really need to put out fewer, better movies: in the 70's, I remember that "Star Wars" played at one local theater for more than a year. Nowadays, a "smash" is here and gone in 2 weeks.). I'm almost as disappointed with my fellow IMDb users as I am with this movie: I used to consider IMDb a good barometer of a movie's worth; I'm very suspicious now. My only hope is that this is some kind of IMDb abuse perpetrated by New Line Cinema. Hope not...
