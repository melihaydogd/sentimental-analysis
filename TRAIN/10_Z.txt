Why the rating is 8.6 stars and so many negative comments
Hi, I'm just wondering why here the rating of the movie is very good - 8.6 by more than 120K people and obviously not so many people liked the movie itself or parts of it.

Also I've read independent comments (not payed articles) of people from my country and from USA who won't rate it more than 5-6/10.

Just statistically if we have 40% negative (or neutral) COMMENTS or REVIEWS and 60% "so great movie" it should be something near for the rating.

What do you think?

Best, Sofia
