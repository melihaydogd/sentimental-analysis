OK, not bad ,not good, just OK
i watched the original cartoon series as a kid and i can say that i loved it. when i first heard that the movie was being made, i got hyped. when i saw the movie i thought it was a master piece, but then i got it on tape and started comparing to the series,and my love for the movie slowly decreased, but i still liked it. the acting was fair, and the comedy OK, but my main problem was loyalty to the series. i liked for a while as a kid....

but seeing it many years later, makes me feel a little awkward.

but still it was an OK movie, they could have been a little more loyal to the series, but i still think it was worth watching once.

PS. compare this one to the SEQUEL, THEN YOU WILL KNOW TRUE SUCKAGE !!!
