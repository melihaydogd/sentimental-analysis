How Much Longer Until It's Over?
The title of this review pretty much says it all. I have never read the book but I fed into the hype and was excited to see this film. Thank God I went on a Monday and only paid half price admission. My sister nearly fell asleep in the theater.

I could spend an afternoon writing what is wrong with this film- there is so many things. I will say it was beautifully shot. Julia Roberts (one of my favorite actresses) did a great job at trying to carry the movie but even she could only do so much. The story was painfully boring with no clear direction. I tried very hard to like it but there was nothing to grasp on to- a few funny moments but no entertainment or important life lessons to be learned.

The biggest problem I had with the film is the main character- I had no interest in a woman who gave up on her marriage and wanted to have flings with cheesy actors and random men all while trying to "find herself". The entire movie made little sense. It was bad all across the board- so much so that it gives me a headache to try and put into words.

I will say thank you to whomever chose Neil Young's "Harvest Moon" as part of this movie. For that I am grateful- it was by far the highlight of the movie for me. It might be better the second time around with a few glasses of red wine and a pizza but I'll spare myself the torture.
