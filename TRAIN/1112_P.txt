Yall are way too hard on this movie
No, it didn't have great fx, no it didn't run on BET after 106 and Park, yes it was an indy film. But I got it. It was different , Cool, smart, and hip. Chenoa Maxwell is breath taking. I don't get all the hard reviews. I loved it and want it on DVD for my collection. I think the director is a little different kinda kat. I liked Have Plenty, and this film G was "on it" all you critics need to watch it again...I got it...maybe you critics went to a bad public school where the Great Gastby wasn't required reading to graduate. Richard T Jones was good in this too, and I like Blair Underwood as a villain. This was ome good stuff. Im tired of gangster, rapper, hip hop laced art...we have too much of it and we need to see some different images of black culture.
