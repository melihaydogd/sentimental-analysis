Not really as beautiful or deep as some people said!!
OK, there is a strong intensity in this movie which is not to be captured by the shallow and will certainly make a lot of people uneasy. I saw some people leaving the moving theater after the 1 hour. Great! Having said that, this is all there is. You want to show how shallow our society is and how empty and dark society is underneath what they try hard to hide? Do it in a humanly way. Why you would add extraterrestrial creatures to show us that? Aren't they busy enough destroying New York, Brooklyn or London and Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones will get to them soon? I love movies and all part of it: plot, trailer, screenplay, acting, production and especially the making of. As a result of this passion I happen to go a lot to the movies theaters, I analyze people's reactions. What they say, what they think, all that. Most of the times, people are right and critics are wrong.
