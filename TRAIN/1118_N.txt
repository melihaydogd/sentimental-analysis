Horrible no scary waste of 2 hours.
For those of you saying this was a masterpiece or brilliant or one of the best scary movies ever I have 2 words for you scr@w you! What a bunch of liars and for your scamming ways to your fellow paying movie goers or red box renters, may god have mercy on your pathetic lying soul. You reviewers being paid on here are in the same class as lawyers and used car salesman. Just pure scum. 10 out of 10 really? Your mother wouldn't rate it a 10 out of 10. I know different strokes for different folks but this was a drawn out dumb idiotic not scary loser of a movie. What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing even happened the first 45 minutes. Not 1 thing. The chick sounded like beavis after he ate too much sugar. Horrible script horrible acting. It was so hard to follow switching back and fourth every 10 seconds. I am honored to say I didn't waste money paying to see it in a theater. Hollywood needs real writers not untalented script writing kids. Just a total waste of 2 hours. Don't even rent this. You are better off watching aliens again for the 8th time. ðŸ˜¡
