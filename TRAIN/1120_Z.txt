Poor film compared to the comic, entertaining stand alone film
Guys this film isn't fantastic. A lot of my favourite dialogue from the comic was cut, and some of my favourite scenes as well.

the ending is that Veidt has been working with Doc Man to create a renewable source of energy to stop the conflict (or so everyone thinks) when really hes just building a machine that simulates Manhattans powers to blow up new york, pinning it on him.

and they changed a lot of the spirit of the comic, for example there's a long unnecessary fight scene at the end between Veidt and Rorschach and Nite Owl, totally unnecessary and obviously added to dumb the film down for more audiences.

and as well as that some characters are down played significantly or even taken out entirely. for example, the new york news vendor doesn't have a single line and the psychiatrist subplot is cut, and only one meeting with Rorschach is shown at all.

Saying that, the action was good, the CGI was incredible, and some scenes were hugely entertaining. A good overall film, but a disappointing adaptation in my opinion.

Zack Snyder has done incredible to stay so faithful to the original comic, but the tone it takes is different to how i interpreted the comic and the themes have been changed significantly.

I appreciate this film, but I don't think I will be watching the watchmen again anytime soon. :P Sorry if I seem cynical, I stress that I was thoroughly entertained throughout this film, but don't go in with high expectations, because its impossible to adapt such a perfect piece of art.
