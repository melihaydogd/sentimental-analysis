Boring movie
The best moment for me in this movie came when it was over.This is a boringly bad movie from Disney-Pixar.<br/><br/>A rat named Remy yearns to be a chef and he lives his dream by giving advice to an ungainly dishwasher in a snooty restaurant in Paris.The restaurant becomes the hottest place to eat and the young man becomes the toast of Paris.<br/><br/>Now the animation is top notch,perhaps the best Pixar animation ever but what kills this film is the script.It isn&#39;t funny at best and is just plain dull at worst.<br/><br/>I was wanting to like this film.Patton Oswalt,who voiced Remy,is a awfully funny stand-up comedian and I was hoping some of that would be displayed in this film.But it wasn&#39;t.You might as well had some Joe from off the street voicing Remy because there was no comedy to be had in this film.Oswalt was stifled by the terrible writing as was all the other people who gave voice to the characters.<br/><br/>I never laughed once during this film and actually don&#39;t remember even smiling either.I wasn&#39;t alone.Very few folks in the sparse audience found anything to laugh at either.<br/><br/>How this film is getting all these great reviews I haven&#39;t a clue.It must be folks who are grooving on the animation and aren&#39;t paying attention that the storyline and script are terrible.<br/><br/>If I hadn&#39;t been bored to near sleep by this movie I would have gotten up and left before it was over.This movie stinks like bad cheese.
