The king has no clothes!
To say this was an unbearable movie would be an exaggeration. It was bearable, bearly, for about 35 minutes.

Its an embarrassment to see this is associated with Pixar. I can only imagine they were for ed to put their name on it to collect royalities.

It reeks of Disney and their predictable, overly saccharine sentiments, with an incipid story, one dimensional characters and a mash of ideas about themes and subplots.

As a triumph of style over substance and a nod to ersatz cultural enlightenment this is a film that can't even justify the evidence of its exostence.

Visually it is a mess and a kind of over stimulated version of a little childs video game. It is devoid of humor, genuine humanist expression and superficial smattering of the Day of the Dead celebration. The characters are so flat that both "alive" or dead they're boring.

To compare this to typical landmark, groundbreaking Pixar movies calls into question wondering exactly what people were watching during Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, etc these early films took the legendary work of early Disney animation artists and elevated it to an entirely different place.they are layered, broadly appealling, entertaining and had a touch of social context and commentary. Truly wonderful movies that deliver viewing upon viewing.

The horses are out of the pen at this point but Honestly - what the hell were these positive reviewers watching!!??
