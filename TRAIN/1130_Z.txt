Not a masterpiece
A grim action movie with OK actors and OK story, but it&#39;s not a masterpiece. Tarrantino seams to add extreme violence and blood in all his movies just to shock the audience around the world. His characters are to one-dimensional to my taste, and I think his style will be exposed as a cheap way to thrill in the future.<br/><br/>&quot;From dusk to dawn&quot; was mush better, see that one in stead.
