Disappointingly Dull
This should have been a fascinating story about how the Sutton Hoo treasures were uncovered and the politics in society and the museum world at the time. Instead we got a film that started off brightly but quickly drifted off into a number of subplots that didn't go anywhere and don't add anything to the story before petering out. Weird.
