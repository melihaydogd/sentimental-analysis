Be warned this movie "sucks"
I am going to put spoilers in this review, but it will probably be more entertaining than the actual movie.

To the point. Nothing happens in this movie that you haven't seen in every other movie. Captian America is involved in a conspiracy that involves the company he works for- seen it. Captian America looses his leader and must try to figure out the differnce right and wrong-seen it. Captian America must stop a world power- seen it. blah blah blah. This movie is nothing but a repeat of movie scenes that made good movies 15 years ago.

Captian America defeats the bad guy, only to save the bad guy. The same action cost him is life, Oh wait, some mysterious arm has reached out to save Captian Americas life.... who could it be. I was in total suspense for .27 seconds.

Captian America gets on a Shield intercom system and warns everybody that the bad guy ( the same bad guy from 70 years prior) had taken control and should be stopped-at all cost. Given a liberating speech to all who can hear-seen it. Problem is who on board can remember or even is aware of and evil group from 70 years ago.

Scarlett Jo. looked terrible, fake tan, everyone wore pink lipstick. I can get past a terrible story line if things looked good, but....

Of coarse Captin America had to get his old suit out- seen it.

Absoultey nothing of any importance happens in this movie. Tha bad guy isn't stopped, the "death" of a leader didn't happen, the world isn't a better place. Captin America says Shield has to be stopped....So he shoots down 3 airplanes. WTC... I think Shield is a little bigger than 3 air planes.

All the movie is, is a TV episode. The bad guy is still there, There are still problems to deal with , and the stakes got higher. No wait its not a TV episode, its a sitcom.
