The Jackson Pollock Of Movies
A word of advice... Ignore reviews from people who try to tell you this movie is a bit arty and special. These are the same people who try to dissect a Jackson Pollock painting and explain the splashes to lesser mortals. It's worth 2/10 for the visuals, which are spoiled by the rest of the movie, so 1/10 is generous.This thing tries to be something it isn't. It's like a French film, with absolutely no plot, then just at the end when you're starting to get really bored and wondering why you bothered, nothing happens! Take away Scarlett Johansson, and you're left with a bit of funky camera-work. Take away the camera-work and you're left with absolutely nothing.Don't waste your time... unless you think Jackson Pollock's splashes are a bit special.
