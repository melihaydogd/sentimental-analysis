Don't expect the Matrix
The film is set in a fascist England of the future. You can't forget that the characters are English, because the keep saying b******s all the time. As I grew up in London I found this quite amusing as we just don't speak like that. I guess that is what the future brings. Natalie Portman gives a lukewarm performance, but Hugo Weaving is excellent especially considering he is behind an expressionless mask - it really was a mask not a Keano Reaves impression! While well crafted and well acted, this film is not ground breaking entertainment. The special effects are good, although when the action comes it is a bit bloody. The idea of Guy Fawkes as anarchistic is amusing although totally inaccurate. I am sure many will like this film more than I did, so don't let me put you off, but for me it was like champagne with no sparkle.
