Don't Chase After This DVD
The Chase has one of the best casts ever assembled. At least three generations of Hollywood are represented here from Miriam Hopkins and Henry Hull, to Marlon Brando and Angie Dickinson, and finally to up and coming stars like Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. I'm still trying to figure what all the fuss was about.

The film opens with the luckless Robert Redford escaping from a Texas prison with another convict who murders a passing motorist and then takes off stranding Redford. He's guilty even if he didn't do the actual killing.

Poor Bob has no luck, his wife Jane Fonda is not staying faithful and true, but she's been carrying on with James Fox, the son of the local kingpin E.G. Marshall.

Marlon Brando is the sheriff who people think takes his marching orders from Marshall. He'd like to bring in Redford alive, but for reasons I'm still trying to figure out, everybody has this real hatred for Redford and no one talks of anything else. It all ends rather badly for a few of the cast.

Arthur Penn directed Lillian Hellman wrote the screenplay and with the cast they assembled you'd think something better would have emerged. Brando who sometimes is accused of mumbling his lines, does so with a vengeance and looks bored and the rest of the cast follows suit.

I don't think Marlon Brando's most devoted fans would particularly like this one. Skip it by if it's broadcast unless you're a stargazer like me.
