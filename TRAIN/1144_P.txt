Melody
When you look at Musicals, as a genre, the train of thought is immediately followed by a cheesy and cheeky end, that you might've seen on any other film. This doesn't have any, this does however contradict logic a couple of times, but movie is meant not to be perfect, but to encourage perfectness. I despise Musicals, but now after watching this, I must refute from my claim, partially. This movie has a charm, an aura, beautiful colors, and beguiling melody. Jazz, is jazzing throughout the movie, the reverberations, the claps, the beats, the shakes, the chords all blend into unison to concieve a piece as great as this. Audio though was a little brittle (don't know if it's universal, or for the theatre I watched in). Watch it if you love Musicals, And watch it if you hate them.
