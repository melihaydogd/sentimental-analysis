"I'm a priest, not a saint."
I agree that the movie doesn't have to be the same as the book. But I have read the book and I know that the story can be better than what's portrayed here in this film. So that's why I give 6-6.5. If I didn't know the original plot, my rate would be higher. The main things that I didn't like were the revenge part (awfully lazy made) and the end (kinda Disney-cheesy). For me, the actual storyline is was more enjoyable and entertaining.
