Didn't work for me
Noah (2014) Director: Darren Aronofsky

Considering that the Noah's Ark story is a fairly popular one and concise in its narration, I was quite interested in what Aronofsky was going to spin.

Honestly, this movie didn't work for me. The amount of artistic license taken is plenty and the movie pretty much ended up being a fairy tale. The Watchers (fallen angels who didn't figure in any Noah Ark story till date), the tyranny of Tubal-Cain (never reference him in any other Noah Ark story) and the absence of the wives of Ham and Japheth (as per the accepted various ancient versions of this biblical story where 8 humans traveled the Ark) really didn't work for me.

The casting was pretty good. Crowe, Connelly, Winstone Hopkins and Watson were top notch. The son's of Noah were too young â€“ Logan Lerman from the Percy movie is miscast here and Douglas Booth as Shem was baffling. With all the liberties Aronofsky was taking I was rooting for them to die in the movie.

Good special effects were the saving grace of this movie and overall the movie is over-rated. If you haven't watched it, then save your time for something else.
