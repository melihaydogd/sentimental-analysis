Not as good as I hoped
The concept was a good one to take on as there have been a number of high profile abduction cases over the past twenty years or so. But I wasn&#39;t totally convinced with the script on this one.<br/><br/>It was a good effort in showing the psychological problems and scars that the victims are left with. For me, the best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes - they were the most realistic. And the final narration by the young lad was well written - but a five year old wouldn&#39;t be that eloquent. The first half of the story based in the room didn&#39;t really work well in my estimation.<br/><br/>Despite that, all the major players did a fine job, although I wouldn&#39;t say Oscar worthy. I wouldn&#39;t recommend people to go the movie theater to see this one - you can wait till it comes round on streaming or a movie channel - or Red Box.
