Instead of this, try reading Orwell
V for Vendetta was a weak attempt at political commentary and a simplistic illustration of revolution. I couldn't help but laugh at the ending with the fireworks and people. I think I'm going to make a movie that harps on peoples ignorance and emotions. I'm going to fill it with images of death for shock factor, make knives fly in slow motion (instead of bullets like they did in the matrix) because I can't think of anything original, and make my protagonist hero/terrorist speak so "eloquently" so that the movie seems smart because no one can understand the alliteration blather coming from behind that mask. The one thing I was impressed by was Hugo Weaving's ability to recite his lines. Natalie Portman was garbage as always. Characters: all 1-dimensional. The action was generic and predictable. When it comes to IMDb ratings, some people jump to say that this is "the worst movie ever" and give it one star. That is silly as anyone with a brain can see that there is a tremendous difference between it and "SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses" which holds a bottom spot on this site. However, it is not even close to worthy of a top 250 berth. 6/10
