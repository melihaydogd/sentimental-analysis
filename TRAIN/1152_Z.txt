Michael Bay......please stop
If i could force one director into retirement, it would easily be Michael Bay. The man produces the most cringe worthy dialog, and the most clich√©' sequences. Many may argue that if it wasn't for him, there wouldn't be those big budget blockbusters. Uh, correction........if it wasn't for those talented visual effects artist and million dollar executive producers, then we wouldn't have those movies. Yes, i realize that he is not directing this movie. It is DJ Caruso's job......but i cannot help but think that Bay will be pulling all the strings. Case in point, "Nightmare on Elm St.".

The movie starts out like any other Michael Bay flick. Every character is beyond good looking, the main character has trouble fitting in, there is always a hot blonde who is Australian, and the first 30 to 45 minutes is filled with a boat load of High School Drama sequences. Okay, i get it, you hated jocks as a teen. You do not need to make the quarterback the villain for the first half of the movie. I mean come on, it's a movie about a closet superhero alien who is on the run from renegade bad guys from outer space. Making a jock the villain just doesn't add up. Well, unless I'm watching the Disney channel.

However, i do think the concept for this film is alright. It does have some slight potential. But it is literally short lived. Mainly because every single sequence is topped off with the cheesiest one-liner. I honestly believe that if this film wasn't put together by these two doofuses, then there might have been something here.

Bottom Line.......This movie would be great for your 8 year old. In fact, no it wouldn't. Because i couldn't live with myself if i raised my kids on crappy dialog filled movies. It's a dull witted attempt to create an "X-Men" type series. But it came off like the movie "Jumper".....oh wait, who directed that again?
