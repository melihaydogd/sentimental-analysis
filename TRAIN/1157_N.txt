Messed up and grotesque but boring
There are weird Japanese movies...Than there is Noboru Iguchi movies. His movies seems to get more messed up with each installments. Movies like this show that just because a movie is weird and grotesque doesn't equal a cool or entertaining flick. Iguchi was a porn director before making these exploitation flicks and it really shows in this one. With constant fetishes from farting, pooping, things coming in and out of the anus, mouth and eye balls. Oh and tentacle rape. And also has crap covered zombies, high school girls that know karate, sexual harassment dudes, skanky girls, parasites, crazy scientist, and some psycho school girl. So yeah it combines messed up exploitation stuff in one movie. Yeah, it's messed up and gross but I didn't feel like I was amused or entertained or found anything that happen in this flick to be cool. Some audiences that are into these fetishes might like it though.3.6/10
