Overrated
Now don&#39;t get me wrong, the film is alright, but its nowhere near as good as the cult following this film has makes it out to be. On the plus side, the cast is definetly great. All the principles are completely immersed in their roles, and give magnificent performances. However the directing does feel a bit amateurish at times, and the script is out and out weak. The story revolves around a botched diamond heist where the thieves involved suspect one of their own is a rat. I don&#39;t know if it was because of a small budget or just a weak script but the story doesnt come off as good as it sounds.<br/><br/>For starters the film uses a very disjointed means of telling the story. However there&#39;s no real flow to it. Most of the movie is set in a warehouse after the robbery, with the charachters trying to figure out the snitch. You&#39;d think the movie would build up to this fact, but it gets revealed midway through. Fair enough. In fact the part of the movie that goes into the snitch&#39;s story is probably the best part. So you&#39;d think there&#39;d be some really big conclusion instead, right? Not really. This film has got to have one of the weakest most abrubpt endings I&#39;ve ever seen. Hell they never even actually show the robbery, which sounds interesting and is something i would have like to have seen as a viewer, but instead its only referred to. So, if you&#39;re really big on violent crime films, fine. Go ahead and give it a go, but be warned, its nothing compared to the work of, say, Guy Ritchie. And if you&#39;re just seeing this movie to find out what all the buzz is about, you&#39;re going to be really dissappointed. Go rent something like Jackie Brown or Snatch instead.
