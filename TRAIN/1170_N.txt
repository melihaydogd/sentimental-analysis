I really wanted to like this movie...I'm a fan of Scarlett Johansson, & I like original material like this, but I waited for something great to come out of it, but when I finished it I just thought it was dumb...& btw, I watch movies for entertainment purposes, not for some slow type of arthouse crap that's trying to make a statement..
