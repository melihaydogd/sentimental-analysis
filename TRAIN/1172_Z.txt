Disappointing
Watched this my children (11 and 13) as a &quot;treat&quot;. Sorry kids! <br/><br/>I have been a big fan of Pixar from day one, but this movie just didn&#39;t work. Without a doubt the animation was excellent but where was the storyline, the characterisation and (sadly) the laughs? <br/><br/>The strength of movies of the calibre of Toy Story is that within moments the audience forgets it is watching CGI and gets wrapped up in the story and characters. With Ratatouille the sole strength is the CGI.<br/><br/>I would have much preferred to watch a movie with OK animation that had an interesting plot but here all the energy had been put into making rat fur look realistic.<br/><br/>Gets 4 out of 10 for being visually stunning and beautifully executed. Would have grabbed a 10 if the script and characterisation had been up to expected Pixar standards.
