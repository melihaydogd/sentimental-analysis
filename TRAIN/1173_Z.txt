Not working
The casting is a miss all around staring with the lead. Add to that a bad attempt to add humor and "clever" sarcasm to a murder mystery and it just means nothing is working. Different casting, better writing and focus on a murder mystery might have salvaged this, but it's not engaging enough to even care who did it.
