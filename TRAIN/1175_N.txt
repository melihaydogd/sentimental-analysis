Crazy but poster oversells it
Acting is amazing by almost everyone. Matthew M. has never been better. Nice to see Gina Gershon doing what she does best. Thomas Haden Church is wasted but who cares. Emile Hirsch is a good actor but needs to start picking better roles. What was he doing in The Savages. Movie is just 4 people for the most part. Plot is something you've seen many many times before but it's not even worth remembering since it doesn't matter. Movie seems more like a character study. For some reason it was listed as action in some places. It's definitely anything but action. Very slow and never really gets going. I kept waiting for it to turn into a Blood Simple type movie but it never goes anywhere. Lots of muff but I give this movie no luff.
