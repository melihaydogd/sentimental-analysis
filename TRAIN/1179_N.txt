Disobey, and you die....Don't Watch This Movie
Please don't waste your time on this movie!!!! I don't mind suspending some reality when I'm watching a movie but this will require a lobotomy to extract any enjoyment.

Just few idiocies...

An evil computer can make high tension power transmission lines overload and snap exactly in the right way so the wires can fall and kill someone.

Computers can read lips and follow conversations observing video feeds or even vibrations on the surface of a cup of coffee.

Evil crystals about the size of a 1 carrot diamond can destroy the US Capitol building.

Just a side note I love the "moral" message at the end of the movie. Wow, I learned my lesson about the evils of computers, right wing Republican governments and homeland security.

Thank you for the lesson Hollywood I will change my evil ways.
