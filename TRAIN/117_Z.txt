Shakespearean potboiler of the underworld.
Zulfiquar is great expectations belied. Srijit's attempt to adapt two of Shakespeare's tragedies to the underworld of the Kolkata docks does not really come off.Yes, the characters are modeled on characters of the Bard's plays,....that's about all.Splitting up Mark Antony's character into two...Dev & Parambrata was a disastrous move . The tragedy is missing ...you feel no sympathy for any of the characters...the action scenes are mostly contrived and dragged out. Srijit mentioned before the release of this film that it was a tribute to The GodFather. What a poor tribute!! Compare Vishal Bharadwaj's adaptations of Shakespeare's tragedies...Maqbool, Onkara,and Haider and you can see the difference.
