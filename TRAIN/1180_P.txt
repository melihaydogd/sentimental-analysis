Before even thinking about writing this review I had to watch this superb movie once again. Words to use to describe this movie are hard to find.

Ben Affleck, J.K. Simmons, Anna Kendrick, and John Lithgow. Just some of the great actors in this gem.

Mention that a movie has any one of those names and I will be interested in watching it. Put them all in the same movie and I will have no hesitation in watching it. In this case multiple times on repeat it is so good.

The one thing that gives me goosebumps every time I even think about this movie is the sense of honour the main character has, he will do anything for those he loves or he thinks deserves his protection. In my opinion this is all down to his father and the way he was brought up. Real genuine friends are hard to find and when you do find one you do everything to protect them.

The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick is as clear as day and that was another thing that makes this movie so good for me.

This is a must watch movie, I highly recommend it.
