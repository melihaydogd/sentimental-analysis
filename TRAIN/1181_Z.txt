Good starting film at first, then goes downhill
After much persuasion from my kids, insisting to watch this movie ever since the first day the film is released, I finally give it a go and took them yesterday at gsc Melawati mall. Have you ever notice certain malay films they started of with a grand scale filled with tons of great scenes and the balance Â¾ of the films just lays flat. I notice that in most of mamat khalid's film. He did a great job with a nice Arial view of the river and comedic performance by the actors delivered strongly on the first 20-30 minutes. I absolutely love every scenes from Mr ropie Cecupak in that first 30minutes. Holy crap he even reminded me about the long time television commercial jingle for a juice company. Funny fella. The broken English he uses kept me laughing. The rest of the thespians also do justice in their roles but not as outstanding as Mr ropie.

It is not a must see movie, you still have other options to see it afterwards unless you have a lot of free time to spare, then go see lah. Congratulations on the producers and director on collecting millions in profit from the many malays that you have suck and seduce into your Hantu Kak Limah movie realms.

If mamat khalid is reading this review, ill bet you are a very happy person now. Please don't forget to contribute this movie profit into your zakat payments ya...hehehe
