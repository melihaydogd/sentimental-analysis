Just for kicks throw in a plot
Couldn't wait for the movie to end. Unless you like basically unrelated scenes, barely a thread holding a film together and an over the top ending, you can skip this one. Why not throw in a plot? Pacino's character lays out what could have been a plot but no. I knew it was going to be trouble when we watch Brad Pitt driving home for 5 minutes with nothing happening. Spoiler alert not necessary. There's nothing to spoil!
