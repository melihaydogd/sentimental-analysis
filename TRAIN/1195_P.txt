now that's what i call method acting. The eyes and facial expression says it all.
When I saw the trailer of dollars, that time only I predicted that Matthew's gonna win the best actor Oscar. But at the same time a lottuva people I know were placing their bets on Leonardo for wolf of ...I mean just look at Mathew, he looked like an hiv patient. His acting was too good man. In fact I jus saw this movie again on hbo, at 2 am. I dint got the time to write the review when I first saw the movie. I m writing this while am watching it on hbo. It's a sad thing that the cbfc here in India plays a spoilsport by censoring all the English movies even if it's aired after 1 am, while ignoring the trash bollywood item songs openly broadcasted in daylight. Fucktards, never cut the violence portrayed in bollywood movies but all action n horror movies are chopped here. Fucktards even went on to delete scenes from the girl with the dragon tattoo that too in theatres. Good Daniel Craig refused to allow that to happen. But ultimately it's people who wants to watch, they are deprived. Coming back to the movie, it was a very good movie with excellent acting and editing.
