It was a good saturday afternoon movie
The movie itself is not bad, i liked the characters, the story made sense, if you want to watch it give it a try, you will know where the story leads when you watch it but you can still enjoy your time. The humor was enjoyable, the interractions between the characters are fun, maybe the one thing that was missing for me is a stronger ending, but it was not meant to be a "fight the world and win" movie so i think it was ok.
