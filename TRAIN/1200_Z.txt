Too long
It&#39;s too long and it gets very very boring some times. There are a lot o movies which exploit much better this idea In the beginning of the movie there is not even a clue what is going on but i guess this is a movie trick used by the director.It&#39;s not about the fact that they have not escaped in those years. It&#39;s about the fact that the movie,after they escape shows a very little preoccupation for the true situation of the characters,of the inside fight. At least it is a better candidate for the Oscar prize, but it is not a movie which deserves a position in top 250 or to be nominated for Oscars. It is good when you put it besides the big short,spotlight,the revenant,bridge of spies, but come on... I hope Mad max will have a serious chance for winning the prize
