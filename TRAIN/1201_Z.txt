Strictly Average!
Cameron Crowe's 'Aloha' is strictly an average fare, with a few good moments. But overall, Crowe hasn't delivered a wholesome Romantic-Drama, that one expects from the prolific Writer-Director.

'Aloha' Synopsis: A celebrated military contractor returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs and reconnects with a long-ago love while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watch-dog assigned to him.

'Aloha' is aimed to be a feel-good entertainer, but in reality, it merely offers a few good moments, that leave a mark. The portions involving the protagonist (Bradley Cooper) & his lady watch-dog (Emma Stone), are cute. But otherwise, nothing really arrests. The sub-plots are weak comparatively, especially the one involving the protagonist's ex-flame (Rachel McAdams). Crowe's Screenplay tries to be a lot of things, but only engages in bits & pieces. His Writing isn't bad, but it isn't strong either. Certainly, Crowe can write better! Crowe's Direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are well-done.

Performance-Wise: Bradley Cooper is awkward all through. Emma Stone is the pick of the lot. She's very natural. Rachel McAdams is sincere. John Krasinski is alright. Bill Murray & Alec Baldwin are wasted. Danny McBride is adequate.

On the whole, 'Aloha' is a so-so fare, at best.
