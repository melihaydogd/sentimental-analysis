Disappointing
I really enjoy old fantasy films with an afterlife theme, such as "Here Comes Mr. Jordan". And I was interested to see the movie because Jack Benny used to make fun of it all the time on his shows. But alas, it doesn't have much to offer. It's not completely dreadful, it's just bland, and not really worth watching, given how many great movies there are from the same era.
