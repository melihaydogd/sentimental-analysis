Diane Lane Under the Sun
After her eye-opening performance in Unfaithful, Diane Lane plays the reverse role of a woman who has a cheating husband.  She ends up in rural Italy trying to find herself and reinvent her life.  With a pinch of hope she embarks on a therapeutic journey and finds eclectic friends, a new language and perhaps love...Can she call this foreign place home?  What is she to do to stay strong and redefine happiness for herself?With a nice supporting cast, Diane Lane showcases the right mixture of drama & humour to shine once more in this more light-hearted production.Over the top story elements at time, but story well contained and poignant.Worth at least a good rental, but I enjoyed seeing it on the big screen. Lane is so alive, so surreal.  And yes, still beautiful.
