My favorite Spiderman film
This is probably the most enjoyable Spiderman related-media I have seen in a long time.
The hype and all these good reviews were totally justified this time, since "Into the Spider-Verse" manages to be a highly entertaining blockbuster which balances perfectly well the fun and excitement with an engaging plot and impressive visuals.Definitely, one of the best releases of the year. Much better than the dull and uninspired Homecoming movie.
