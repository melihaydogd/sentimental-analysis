A brilliant lesson in how to manage a band.
If you ever wondered how boy bands (yes, even though the Sex Pistols are antipodes to the cosmetic-fairy image of boy bands the principle is the same) are created then this is a must see.The film has a feel of being made fast and cheap but hey its the Sex Pistols so what do you expect?? A misplaced, angry bunch of hoodlums put together to form the most extreme opposite of what the music industry was (and still is) serving as artificially produced boy bands. That's what Malcom Maclaren talks about in the film, how he took 4 guys with no future and made them (for a brief but very explosive period) the center of the music world. Like I said before, this is a must see for all inquisitive music lovers, managers, PR managers and especially music managers because what Malcom tells is sometimes ingenious - like the fact he himself send loads of anonymous hate mail to the media about his own band thus fueling a raged public and a media hype knowing that bad news travels much faster and further than good one. To quote Salvador Dali: "Its good when they talk about me even when they say good things."All in all - its not a movie with a plot but a documentary of how a band is created using Sex Pistols as a brilliant example. I give it a 10/10 not for the film quality but for the lesson.
