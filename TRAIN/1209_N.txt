The Pornography of Destruction (or how cinema is dying)

I am a comic book fan. Learnt to read on Superhero comics in 1970. I loved The Avengers film. I really liked the Captain America film. The Iron Man Films have mostly been great. Thor was good. Liked all the Spidey films. You get the idea....OK. So. I've seen MAN OF STEEL. In 2D, I decided, because I found Iron Man III in 3D just too much wanton destruction, it overloaded my brain. So I took this down a notch. I could bitch about the poor sound system in the smaller screen, but actually it probably didn't affect the film too badly. But.... this was a bloody awful piece of cinema. Says something when the best performances come from Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner. Henry Cavill did what he could with the dullest superhero in history (he's very handsome, incredibly buff and, yay, has chest hair). The film looks spectacular. The costumes are great. The visual effects amazing. But that was the problem with Man Of Steel. All these films now are just trying to out-do each other. Up the ante. This film is little more than wanton destruction in a sickening crescendo. And I just don't get off on it. In fact, I find it offensive. In a world where 9/11 and other atrocities are all too real, I find NO entertainment value in seeing a city of skyscrapers (full of people) being decimated. The pornography of violence. It sickened me. And somewhere lost among it was supposedly a plot (moderately testing to follow) and no characterisation or humanity. It was, frankly, dross. And exhausting dross. I would NOT wish to ever see this film again.
