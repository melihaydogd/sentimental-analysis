Overacted, cliched.
So far I've thoroughly enjoyed all the Coen Bros. Films I've seen. Until now. A misfit bunch of characters trying so hard to be larger than life succeeded only in making me cringe. So much so that I had a headache afterwards. Decent enough plotline and story, but really, the acting was OTT. And, sorry, Julianne Moore, that accent was more Dick van Dyke than Mary Poppins.

So, to summarise: meh!
