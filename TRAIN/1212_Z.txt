Fast forward half of it.
This film was a 2 hour and 40 minute wait for something to happen.

Sure there were a few bits in there to make the time spent waiting pass, e.g. gratuitous sex and violence (Dizzee Rascal might love this film)but nothing really came of it.

Ever bought a packet of fruit pastels only to discover that it's mainly filled with green ones and no blacks? Well, that is what watching this film feels like.

I have not read the comic book, and probably never will, but it seems a lot of the film I spent questioning things: do these guys have super powers or are they just lush at fighting? why does the blue guy spend most of the time naked?
