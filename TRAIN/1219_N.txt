propaganda for "good Nazis"
after watching the movie one could have had sympathy for the Nazis (if you would not already hate them). it is ridiculous that this work was giving a nomination for Oscar. what else is to say? one of the Nazis, I think his name was Speer , is shown as a kind of good knight. but it is a historical fact, that this man is disliked by his own son, because he never reflected his time as a Nazi as an error or something. it is proved since over 20 years by now that he had known that 1000 of Jews had to work to death in his arbeitslager - they had to break stones for the Nazi-buildings. there is a scene where Hitler talks about that the Jews are the cause for everything bad in the world, that they are a plague. As he said so, his secretary looks to him (camera has a great view of her facial expression) as if he is crazy, as if she could not believe what he is saying. this is ridiculous: as if she wasn't an antisemit on her own ! but, why this ? the answer is simple: the book for the movie was created under the helping hand from this secretary. it is easy, eh ? Hitler was crazy (at the end (of his Reich)), and there were a lot of bad, but also a lot of good Nazis. and have a look at the end of the film: there is said that so and so millions of humans died in the WW2. and then, a new screen: so and so many Jews died . so: are Jews no humans, or what ? ... you should see the movie, and try to imagine if you would not known anything about this period of mankind: one could really have sympathy: For Adolf Hitler and his Nazis.

really, this movie i dislike.
