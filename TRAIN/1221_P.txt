"And the rest is silence"
So quotes (from someone such as Shakespeare) one of the main characters of the OLDBOY remake before he . . . maybe to appreciate this moment, I need to mention that his own dad did exactly the same thing after he had . . . but you need to go back even further to what happened in the greenhouse at the old prep school . . . or maybe start with the other main character, played by Josh Brolin, who's just been tricked into . . . no, as the guy who I think was in DISTRICT 9 says, it's best to be silent about OLDBOY. Better yet, maybe YOU should NOT see OLDBOY at all. Once you've seen something, it's pretty hard to UNSEE it. (Just ask a PTSD sufferer how cheap and easy it is to put visual toothpaste back into the tube of stuff your brain has never encountered.) I know folks who wish they had NOT seen the HUMAN CENTIPEDE. I know older geezers who would like to UNsee THE DEVILS, even decades after exposure. No one can forget LITTLE NICKY, or any of those flicks where body orifices are sewn shut. Some people even take exception to the finale of BRAVEHEART. Be warned: Do NOT see OLDBOY if friends have said you're the "sensitive type," if you have not already prepped by viewing the much tamer ANGELS & INSECTS, or if it's a "weak stomach" day for you. Enough said.
