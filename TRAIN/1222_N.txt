Made up nonsense

As a re-enactor who displays this period, I was excited to see this. I wish I hadn't watched it now. Why is it so hard for Hollywood to do a little research into our history and at least try to get some of it right. Even Shakespeare didn't get it this wrong. If you are looking for a medieval romp then you'll love it, if you know anything about this period, don't torture yourself.
