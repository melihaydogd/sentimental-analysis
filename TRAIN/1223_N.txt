Worst makeup ever
The zombie face paint was of a skill level normally only seen in primary school musicals, or on students during Halloween. It looked like an enthousiastic crafts teacher had tried really hard to make it look scary but working with the pallette of the springfestival children's fairy facepaint kinda really hampered their creative ambitions.
The acting was bad, comedic without the jokes, that bad.. but still it could distract me from that stunningly awfull facepaint, who in their right mind could think that was a good idea? It is a blight on a genre that has produced such gems as Z Nation and the Walking Dead, the producers of this thing really need to be ashamed of themselves. Even Zombieland was way better than this.
