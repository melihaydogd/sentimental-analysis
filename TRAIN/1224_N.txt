a very bad movie based on a very good TV series
I loved the A-team TV series but this movie is an unsuccessful attempt, it is super noisy,pointless,very confusing and over crowded ...up to 20 minutes through the movie still you will read titles and credit texts.the story starts with so called Hollywood labelled bad guys,in this case a few Latinos that in spite of their greater number they are defeated by 2 guys,then all of sudden they are talking about going Baghdad and talking to go to Kabul too and so on,I think movie making in Holiwood hit the bottom with this one. dialogues are suppressed with a load soundtrack and lots of human ah & ooh,& machine noises,Everybody's yelling,shouting and speaking in the same time please don't waste your money and time to see this movie. Thanks
