pointless movie
This was totally horrible in 1996, and is still totally horrible. The plot is written for 13 year old boys with hooded outfit bought at the nearest wall mart with FBI written on the back. Embarrassing to watch, and annoying to rethink as an adventurous possibility. Completely out of touch. A true turkey. A gift to the imbecile. How anyone can take pleasure in watching this is beyond pathological human understanding. Not only does the main character lack a focal point, or at least possess something to believe in - the main figures are all turning into clowns while working hard to be the "bad guys" and "good guys". I cannot describe the full disgust - and wonderful relief combined, while pressing the eject button on the DVD player.
