Just wasted two hours
I enjoy an off the wall movie but OKJA was a big disappointment. The movie looked promising at the beginning but quickly became predictable. The message intended was overshadowed by the unnecessary violence and those who suggest this is a good movie for children must not have watched the same movie I did. The use of the F-bomb, which was totally unnecessary to the plot and/or message of the film, and the violence makes this film unacceptable for children. To be honest, I think the message is too adult for OKJA to be classified as a children's movie. I can just imagine the questions my 7 year old granddaughter would ask me and I know OKJA would have upset her.
