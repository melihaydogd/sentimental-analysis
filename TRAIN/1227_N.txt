One 'Alien' Was Enough
The first of these movie, "Alien," is in my DVD collection but not the rest, beginning with this sequel. I'm sorry but having low-life people portrayed as astronauts is ludicrous and insulting. I put up with it in "Alien," but it's even worse in this film, beginning with Sigourney Weaver's character who is extremely profane and butch-like in her macho-feminist overdone characterization.

Who cares about scary aliens when the supposed "good guys" are this sleazy? The cast fits the scummy people perfectly as these actors are known for these kind of roles. It's just another in a line of films directed by James Cameron that feature scumbags as the lead characters.

Of course, the sick critics loved it. Figures.
