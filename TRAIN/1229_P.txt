Interesting premise and weird animation, but ultimately boring
The animation is like Tokyo Godfathers and Perfect Blue. The story is a mix of The Cell (the one with Jeniffer Lopez) and Ghost in the Shell. The music is very well chosen.  Now, the basic feel of the movie is great: a lot of tension, kept going by the music, and the spirit of the collective consciousness that permeated Ghost in the Shell. But that's just the first quarter of the movie. Afterwards there are a lot of dreamscapades that make no or little sense, the feeling of it fades, the film becomes self referential (like scenes that did not have any meaning before now are mixed in the story) and nothing really ensues from this chaos. The bad guys are pretty obvious and the ending is completely confusing.  Bottom line: a pretty interesting concept carried by very appropriate music crashes in confusion. Of course, if you make the effort, you will understand a lot of the metaphors and some of the spirit of the film, but ultimately, it's just some Japanese guy's dream that not all of the viewers can really share.
