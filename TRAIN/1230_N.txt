It's low budget and you can immediately see it's low budget...
This is definitely a movie that I will never watch again and where I hope that there will never be a sequel. There are so much things that bugs me about this movie that I don't know where to begin. The way of filming the action scenes is really bad. The whole interview feeling that you get throughout the entire movie is extremely annoying. The actors are not good at all. Okay it might be low budget but that is no reason to make a bad movie. All the fighting scenes look like it are just grown up men playing laser tag or a bunch of buddies having a paint-ball weekend. The decor and the locations are also not good at all. I can't really say anything good about this movie because there isn't. It could have been good if you had better actors, a better script, another director, more money etc. Avoid this one because there are way much better movies in this genre.
