Entertaining Heist
(Really late and brief) Ocean's 8 Review (since I'm on vacation without any service).Ocean's 8 is apart of the Ocean's movie anthology, which I haven't seen any other movies. I enjoyed the film. The performances were all great. The costumes in the movie were good. The editing was good. The pacing was pretty slow at first and I thought I was going to get bored but it picked up later on. Also there was a part towards the end where I thought it could've ended but it went on for another 15 minutes which was setting up for more sequels. Other than that it was enjoyable but not great.My Grade: B-
