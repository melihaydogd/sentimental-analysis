Shaun of the dead? No. But not a bad attempt
This film offers no real surprises. Thats pretty much this movie in a nut shell. Its your typical zombie fare with just a few extra political and social themes thrown in to try and give you characters that aren't the norm for this kind of flick. The plot is kept simple, in this film, the zombie virus is used by terrorists as a biological weapon (I know, its the animated Resident Evil plot. Just go with it) Stupidly, its unleashed on a small ISLAND community... Isn't that kinda the worst possible place for this kind of thing? If you wanted to kill a lot of people, wouldn't you release it on the mainland or a major city so it can spread? Anyway, I digress. The meat of the film is nothing special, typical zombie outbreak with a few gay jokes thrown in to give the slower members of the audience a giggle. But this film does deliver where its needed, its a true B movie, with ridiculous and one dimensional antagonists. Along with main characters who were clearly written with the thought "How can we get the most puns out of these guys?"Really, the true and honest glory of this film comes towards the end, when one of the cardboard villains mentioned above (I won't spoil who) gets attacked by a zombie, who rips his arm off and proceeds to beat him to death with it. I kid you not, I watched that scene at least 4 times. I wouldn't say that this is a zombie flick that you HAVE to see. But you could definitely do worse. It knows what it is, and sticks to just how corny the writing is and delivers what anyone with brain would expect from a film with this kind of budget. Go watch it, but don't expect to fall in love with it.
