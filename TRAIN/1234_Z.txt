above average
indubitably, cagan irmak is one of the best directors in Turkey. It is quite clear that he is a talented person whose films are discernible from the other junk films. His TV-series called cemberimde gul oya was his masterpiece. Even though i am not a cry-baby, every Friday when it is aired, i cried so much that i usually have headache after each episode. His first short-cut film was also quite remarkable called bana old and wise i cal. When all of these considered, i went to babam ve oglum with high expectations yet i could not find something just above the average. The performances were perfect but the movie itself exploits feelings. If you want to cry do not miss it because it is nearly one hundred percent possibility that you will.
