Frighteningly prophetic and blisteringly relevant
It's remarkable how this film came to us before Brexit, before Trump and before the pandemic. Granted, it was borne out of disillusionment and rage over Bush and Blair's corrupt handling of domestic and foreign affairs back in the day and post-9/11 (hence the themes of Islamophobia). But with time the film has only become more topical than it was in 2006, when I was asleep and didn't even know of its existence. More than a decade later, I have finally now seen it and I am left wondering what lessons we as a people still have yet to learn about our governments and their descent into totalitarianism. There's no telling if it has predicted even more of our future. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone.
