Lazy writing riding on nostalgia...
Total waste of time, full of plot holes, senseless and illogical... It was good seeing the gang again but totally disappointed by the degraded storyline...
The lack of Intelligence and effort behind the duels in this movie is really irritating..
We need to have standards when rating movies/shows or else It all becomes pointless
