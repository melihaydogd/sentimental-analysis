What a piece of junk
This movie is what makes people download movies elsewhere instead of buying them. You just don't know what to expect from movies anymore. Big marketing for a load of bullshit. There's absolutely no quality in this movie. Bad acting, bad comedy. The story is so cheesy. The characters in this movie are not very believable.

I have difficulty understanding how an actor like Liam Neeson could agree to take part in a movie like this. I mean, the guy was in Schindler's List, Gangs of New York, Kinsey etc.

The computer animated effects are so cheesy that a 10-year-old would be able to spot them. Even if this was the first movie that they saw.

Give me back those 2 hours, Hollywood!
