an important message tarnished by goofy film techniques
Although the purpose of this film was to denounce the use of nuclear weapons, I so hated the style of the film that the message was largely lost on me. While I loved some of the the director's other works ("Night and Fog" is brilliant), I was annoyed by the "artsy" tone of the film and the excessive reliance on New Wave sensibilities. I'll be honest and up front about this--I hate most of the Godard films I have seen and several of those of Resnais. Strange camera angles and the avoidance of normal movie conventions may impress some, but I felt lost. I hated the goofy poetry-like dialog that was used while scenes went back and forth between the lovers and documentary footage of the civilians of the Hiroshima post-blast. It seemed to trivialize and muddle the impact of their pain.

So why did I give it a 3 and not a 1? Well, I have seen a lot of French films and there are some whose level of awfulness reaches far greater heights than this film (and there are some that are absolute masterpieces). If you think this film is bad, try watching "Alphaville" or "Last Night At Marienbad"--now THESE are really bad French films!
