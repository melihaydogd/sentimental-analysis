Not fast nor furious, but who cares?
Booksellers Joel (Franchot Tone) and Garda (Ann Sothern) take a vacation to Seaside City, but get involved in a murder when the promoter of a beauty pageant is found killed.I watched this just because I like Franchot Tone, and was pleasantly surprised. Ann Sothern was much less annoying then she was in Lady Be Good. The mystery is neat, and there's a excellent scene where our heroes are almost crushed by the stage lift. It's definitely an offbeat film for director Busby Berkeley.Good fun. First time viewing. 3/5
