SKYNET Fights Back
Yes and this is not a TERMINATOR movie, what if all that Cybernetic Computers take over the world. A "Down to earth version" of that scenario is D.J. Caruso directed Eagle Eye.

Originally taken from the idea of Isaac Asimov's short story "All the Troubles of the World " DreamWorks brings Eagle Eye penned by writers John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz, and Dan McDermott.

It got good story, good execution, a little plot holes but all in all it's a GOOD Sci-Fi Realistic movie. But the problem is the terrible Female lead played by Michelle Monaghan. She ruined everything what the movie originally intended for. A good suspense film reduced to a "Single Mother/Working Woman's Heroic struggle" movie - with a young lad as a Sidekick.

A real bad casting for the movie. If she had remained away from the movie I would definitely give this movie 10 out of 10. But instead I go for a 3! Only because,

1)Shia LaBeouf - his brilliant take of an identical twin who lost the other half, out running the performance of Rachel Weisz in a similar situation from the movie Constantine .

2)D.J. Caruso - The 'Disturbia' Director for adding a different suspense tone to an ordinary SCI-FI Action movie. A subject which was vastly covered in the movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stealth, I Robot, Terminator 1-2 and so on.

3)Steven Spielberg - for NOT DIRECTING THIS MOVIE!

Eagle Eye = Good for a "SINGLE" Watch.
