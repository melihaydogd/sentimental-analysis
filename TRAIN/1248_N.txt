Absolutely terrible. I was angry.
A waste of my time. I saw something for the first time ever when I saw this movie, 4 people just got up and left during the movie.; a couple and 2 individuals. I admit I was tempted to leave, the most boring and poor movie ever. 99% is pointless shots of nothing. A waste of your time and your money. Why scarlett johansson agreed to it bemuses me, she must be very embarrassed. One character on a motorbike just keeps appearing for no reason. If you like looking at someone riding a bike up and down roads and someone driving a van, next to no speaking and just gloomy shots of a rainy city, no story, no beginning or middle and an end that is just plonked on you that even then has an annoyingly tedious length of time before the titles role (that i couldn't wait for)', then you will love this. The budget must have been about Â£2k, i don't mind that, but it would be nice to know that beforehand so you know what to - and what not- to expect. It seemed to me to be one of those terrible film student flicks, but this is worse as its just pointless,nothing. At least students usually let something happen. I wanted to fake a heart attack to leave early.
