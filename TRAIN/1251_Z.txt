Such a good start, such a lousy outcome...
The premise is good: that kind of sectarian gregariousness that turns people into a brainwashed flock, only to scream "Yes! Yes! Yes!" at a ridiculous guru's finger-snapping - and its impact over one's life.

AND, for almost one third of the movie, the humor works well; Carrey is his old self (old - also in the negative sense: again, again, AGAIN the same grimaces!), but at least we guffaw in laughter often enough.

Unfortunately, around half-ways, the script turns messy, dissociated, incoherent... it departs the efficient logic that had led it till then. And the fun gets repetitive and ever more tired...

In the end, it leaves us with the fateful question: "And so, what...?" But, at least, it is some comedy... Mediocre, but still amusing... Not as the tons of trash that the Hollywood showbiz delivers all year long, under the Apatow and Seltzer signature. Thank God for the small favors - and small time comedies!
