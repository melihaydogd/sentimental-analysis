More like a documentary
In Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort tries to explain what he is doing and then he says that we are probably not going to get it anyway and all that matters is that he is making a lot of money. Well this movie tries to explain everything and some things it does and others it doesn't but the whole point of the movie is explaining how the crisis happened and why, it is more of a documentary than a drama. It tries to be a bit like Wolf of Wall Street with the breaking of the fourth wall which I am OK with. What I am not fine with is the direction which was a bit sloppy on purpose to give it more of a documentary feel which I didn't like. Also it is very informative but it doesn't have much entertainment value, I love dialogue in film but in this one I just didn't understand what they were talking about in some instances. The story could have been presented in a better way but it is still worth seeing just to see how we are being used by the banks. Just for the message and what it exposes I give it a higher grade than I would have which would probably have been a 5.
