Car Porn. Fast forward to the action.
Another Hollywood "Blockbuster for Dummies" movie. Minimal plot, laughable dialogue, lots of eye candy. Why bother thinking up a plot when you can just do a remake? Looking at still images you might think this was a good movie. It makes for a good billboard / trailer / slurpee cup but not an entertaining experience. The cars are gorgeous. Fast forward through the non-action parts of this movie; you won't be missing anything. Then go watch The Italian Job with Michael Caine for a truly excellent car chase action movie.
