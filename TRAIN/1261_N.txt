Bloated, Self-Absorbed Nonsense
All of the fanboys and girls must have also been in love with "The Emperor Has No Clothes" too.

This story is thin, the characters are under developed, the emotional and logical shortcuts are ridiculous, Matt Damon is horribly cast and has become a caricature of himself, the set pieces are not inspiring, the music cues try to be bombastic enough to create emotion that simply doesn't exist and the science is a mess.

When a self-important filmmaker reaches a level of success where no one will tell them "no" anymore, this is what comes of it. The scientific equation that sums up this film is as follows: Nolan + Interstellar = Lucas/Spielberg + Crystal Skull.

A completely unremarkable and forgettable film. The Emperor truly has no clothes.
