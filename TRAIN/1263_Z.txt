Would have been a great mini series
As with any band biopic movie, its impossible to cram in the history inside of 2 hours without losing a lot of context. Motley Crue is not a favorite band of mine, but I do find the formation of them fascinating, especially Mick Mars, who is a great heavy metal guitarist who doesn't get the recognition he deserves.

All in all, its a fun couple hours of living vicariously through Hollywood's take of being a crazy heavy metal band.

Make it into a mini series and take a little more time with true details, and you will have yourself a really intense show.
