Worst epic ever...
I went to see this movie with my mom, I didn't want to but she was hoping to see that movie because she heard of all the good reviews. I don't understand why people think this movie is good. But basically here on the IMDb almost every movie is overly overrated.

-The screenplay... well there is basically no screenplay because I don't know what the director wants to tell me with this movie. -The dialoques are some of the worst I've experienced on a big screen. -The rhythm: there is no rythim at all. It all goes from one thing to another sometimes you don't even understand where the actors actually are located in space. they go, then they suddenly reapear. -That brings me to the editor who didn't do his job properly in telling the director that he actually screwed it up.

My mom and I wanted to leave the theater after twenty minutes. I work in this industry and cinema is going from bad to worse. PLEASE SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY SUCH A GOOD GRADE ON SUCH A STORYTELLING.
