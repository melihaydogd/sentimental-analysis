Bizarre, quasi-funny, fully predictable
It's one of these movies that you watch and ask why would one spend time and money to create it. The realization is quite good. Special effects guys did great job making the pigs interaction realistic; the actors played well.. (assuming they were asked to play weirdos). Now the plot is 100% predictable from the very beginning of the movie. You can even predict what would happen in the sequel of it if it's ever made. If there is any value of this movie, it's bringing attention to the animal fate in our world.. and maybe doubtful BIO/GMO-Free food marketing line of some corporations, but that's it. This could be done with a 2min clip, instead. Anyway, might be good for some bizarre videos fans.
