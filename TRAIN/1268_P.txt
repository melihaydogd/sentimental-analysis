Best film of 2020/21?
I hope Zeller moves from the theatre to film full time because this thing is sublime. Dementia (Alzheimer's disease) runs through both sides of the family, I've seen the disease full throttle. It is nasty and heart-breaking; it destroys everyone around the person suffering.I've a big soft spot for almighty performances. I get a buzz off seeing an actor harness everything in their being to master the craft (DDL in There Will Be Blood; PSH in Capote, The Master). Hopkins is 83; he delivers an absolutely abnormally outrageous performance. One in which, if you're watching it right, will linger long after. It's mesmerising.But to oversell on the acting alone is to do Zeller a disservice. Coleman is also great. The film and its script (adapted from the stage) is just beautiful. It sucks you in, allowing you to fully realise the disease in all its terrible, and dare I say it, funny, contradictions. I wouldn't want to spoil this for anyone. I reckon you should go for it; the worst that can happen is you turn it off after 20 minutes when you realise it's not for you. It was for me. Utterly brilliant.
