When aliens landed in Home and away
Not very much to say. Tin-grade stage props and special effects that take you back to the glorious 80s, you can stomach these if you have a good script in your hands, crafted dialog and some credible acting. None of that here, though. "Honest" Aussie macho cliches for dialog, holes in the script that could let a mothership through, and as for acting... makes your eyes hurt. A low budget sci-fi indie gem it is not. Just a low-budget soap with some aliens in it. I stopped watching less than half-way through.
