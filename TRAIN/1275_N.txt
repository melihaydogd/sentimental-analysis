Not nearly as clever as it thinks it is
Smarmy, arrogant, condescending, and not anything close to being as clever as this film *thinks* it is. You know within 5 minutes, another movie made by a demorat elitist. Some decent performances to be found, hence the 3 stars. Some actors highly under used (lookin at you, Chris Evans). I would say it's mostly a waste of time. It's plots don't twist. The 'whodunit' factor never really comes into play. And when the movies reaches it's climax, like most women who date weak willed, vegan men....you're left thinking, "is that it?" as you wonder off to the bathroom, alone, to finish what was started. My advice? Skip it and save yourself the disappointment.
