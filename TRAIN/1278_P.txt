started out great, kinda went downhill overtime
Seasons 1 and 2 were great, season 3 was ok (although my opinion on that particular season is a bit higher than the general consensus) but season 4 took a major drop in overall quality, the episodes were just all over the place, constantly breaking flow and either going too fast or too slow. for example season 4 episode 7 felt like it kept starting over doing something completely different every time it started gaining any real momentum. they all just didnt feel like fluid stories to me, this is seriously starting to feel like the simpsons where every episode feels like it was written with a game of round robin or something along those lines. i really hope the writers can get this show back on track soon, because i do think they can do it, the show isnt too far gone, they just need to put some effort into it
