Could not shut off my brain enough to like this
The story was so bad I don't even have pity for it.

Science and any reality are completely tossed out the window in this film. Alfonso Cuar√≥n doesn't even try to have something remotely believable. There was talk about them creating suits and special effects that realistically portray current life in space. All lies, I could have overlooked some bending of the rules, but they tossed them all out.

The characters themselves are supposed to be trained astronauts, but not one second of on screen time shows this. Most of the time they are incompetent, then magically they can fly a ship they have little, or no experience with like they've done it all their lives. When Sandra Bullock's character is almost out of oxygen, George Clooney character is there trying to make sure she uses up as much of it as she possibly can.

The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects house did a wonderful job on making things pretty.
