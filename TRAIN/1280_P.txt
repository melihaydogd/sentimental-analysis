Based on a bestseller, named 3 seconds.
This is one of my favorite books, and I've been waiting to see the film. As it sometime is, you have to comprimize. I'm sorry to say that they changed or left out some important stuff in the book, and the ending is as I remember totally different, and better in the book. But it still a good movie good acting and not so much of the Hollywood action that can tend to be a little boring sometime. Kinnaman is good as always. He is the character that makes this story deeper. Followed by some others that are quite good.

Now hopefully they film the two remaining books. 3 minutes and 3 hours.
