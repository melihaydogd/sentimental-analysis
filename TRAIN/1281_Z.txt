What the hell was that?
I found the movie under "Comedy", now could someone please explain me which part of the movie was humorous? It's a violent, gory, action movie. The movie hardly has any substance, no particular story. I'm surprised to see the movie is 90mins long, wondering how they managed it to drag that long. Disappointed out of my mind when trying to watch a comedy movie, this was #21 in the Comedy list.

I have nothing more to add to the review, but IMDb doesn't let me post without a minimum of 10 lines. So this is me filling up 10 lines so that I can post this silly review, and help any other viewers out there who are trying to watch a comedy movie. I should have figured after the first 5mins of the movie, unfortunately I sat through the whole movie. A mistake I regret.
