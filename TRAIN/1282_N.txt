Completely Overrated
Oh my goodness! What can I say about this film? I had heard so much about this movie, mostly good and positive things, so I wanted to check it out for myself. A WW2 movie from the perspective of Hitler during his last days - intriguing premise and should make a brilliant piece of film right? Boy, was I disappointed; this has got to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's full or clich√©s, about an hour and a half too long and the pace is incredibly slow - you won't believe how many times I thought to myself: "just get it over and done with already!" - even I wanted to kill myself by the halfway mark. But by then I had stopped caring. It does nothing to tell us anything new or refreshing about Hitler's last days, so the whole thing was just completely pointless. Yes, it's supposed to capture just how desperate they all became as the Russians closed in and the leader gradually lost his mind; as if he didn't I suppose the one saving grace of this absolutely terrible movie is Bruno Ganz's portrayal of the Fuhrer; he absolutely nails the great leader down to every little mannerism and nervous tick; you'd think Hitler himself had come back from the dead to be in this movie. But then, not even top-notch acting by Ganz can save this awful movie from its "downfall".
