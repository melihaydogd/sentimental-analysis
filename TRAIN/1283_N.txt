Good but OVER RATED
Good action drama movie that delivers all the basics the genre demands.Very good performance by Russell Crowe and sexy Kim Bassinger.A tag too long and drags due to too much dialogue but still manages to compensate with good action sequences.Nothing spectacular or original here so do not expect too much due to many genre fans over rating this movie.It's certainly no classic.The story demands a less Hollywood ending than the one presented here.Only for Noir action drama fans,police/crime action drama movies and big fans of the lead actors......
