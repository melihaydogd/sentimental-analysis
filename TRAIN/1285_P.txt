Pretty typical dystopian film
This film is based on a graphic novel which I admit I haven't read. It's not bad at all, but the setting is quite a generic dystopia which makes the film a bit typical for the genre. It's incredibly unsubtle about its message and the main characters are mouthpieces but it's still a good film.
