Boring. Pedantic. 5 minutes worth of "real material."
Incredibly boring and simplistic plot. Pedantic performances, particularly by Bullock Whiz-bang CGI is nothing more than porn to the Oscar-voting crowd. Whatever Hollywood produces - they have to vote for. They have to vote for something, and give an Oscar to something - however shallow, uninteresting, boring, pedantic, etc.

Too bad Clooney wasted his time on this one. And the plot would have been much better if Bullock's character would have "bought it" within the first 5 minutes.

In fact the whole movie should have been 5 minutes long. That's pretty much how much "real material" the film had. 5 minutes. The end. Boring. Stupid. Pedantic. Move on.
