Total Rubbish
This film is what happens when you get a bunch of creepy Japanese animators with too much time on their hands.  This film is utterly pointless.  A girl wanders around a compound full of ghosts looking for her parents avoiding alot of gruemsome muck.  The main charachter has no character.  She goes from one weird place to another hardly commenting or expressing anything, outside of the stereotypical eye thing japanamation likes to do. It's full of monsters and ghosts doing vague and unusual things trying to be scary. I'm not for being spoon fed meaning in nice bite sized packages but this makes "Brazil" seem focused and straightforward. The film, like many of the charachters, just wanders and lingers around like an alztimer's patient trying to find his way out of a run down funhouse.  Visually it is pleasing, but so is my blender.  If you want to see a bunch of well illustrated weird stuff with no point whatsoever then this is the film for you.
