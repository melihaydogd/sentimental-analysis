Good but not THAT good
The Incredibles, (another) Pixar film, big budget, big names, big special effects etc. This film is fun for all the family, enjoying the mix of childish and adult humour that Pixar do so well. However, due to the hype surrounding this film, and the obsessions which seem to go with it, I feel compelled to inject some reason - The Incredibles is good but not THAT good. It has reasonable scripting, a predictable storyline, does not really take computer animation to new limits, and, while funny does not compare with the likes of Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo (let alone a host of other superior animated films commercially unrecognised). This film is one more Pixar film to add to a growing list of adequate, fun, family films which despite being enjoyable really do add little to "film" as a whole. I would recommend this film to all who want a bit of an escape and do not feel like watching anything intellectually or emotionally stimulating.

In summary, fun for all the family but should NEVER be considered a true great.
