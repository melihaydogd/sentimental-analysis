stunk like a skunk
This movie is not only frustrating, but continues in the cheap horror category to rely on characters with sub-zero IQ. Acting wasn't bad, but plot was so agonizingly reliant on stupidity that I was left frustrated. This is a great attempt at horror by a blossoming writer, but fell far short of frightening, interesting, or satisfying. It should be noted that due to a ten line minimum for reviews, I must go into painful detail about how this movie fails to live up to horror movie expectations (including attempts to understand why stupidity plays such a role in modern attempts to be frightening). This film and a few others like it (scream, freddy versus jason, mercy) utilize protagonists that couldn't wipe their own butts without directions. How on earth can a movie be frightening if you're constantly imagining the character's demise by their own hand in a fashion that would make Charles Darwin shudder at the state of modern man's genetics? If you are looking for a horror movie that won't leave you unsatisfied, and represents a similar horror feel, go watch Babadook. The characters in this movie never grow up from their childhood, and I've met 2nd graders who would have ended this story in about thirty minutes because a single original and useful thought would have done the trick.
