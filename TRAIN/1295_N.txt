It Sucks
Contains Spoilers What is big deal about his borefest? 'L.A. Confidential' is probably the most overrated movie of the 1990s. The story is confusing and boring and so are the characters. Just because the characters talk in low voices and the story is complex doesn't make it "intelligent" or "good". All the characters are shallow and some of them act like they don't want to be there, espicially Kevin Spacy and Kim Basinger. In the end, there is your cliched shootout where all the good guys win and bad guys die. Russell Crowe gets shot three times, even in the face and still survives. Also in the end the pretty girl kisses the hero. And this is supposed to be one of the best movies of the past decade?
