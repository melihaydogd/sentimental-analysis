Positive Surprise
I didn't have high hopes, when I went to see this.Immediately though I was captivated by the beautiful visual style in both the landscape, architecture and especially the cool technology (HUDs and touch-screens etc.). It was simply stunning!As for the plot, it wasn't too original as such, but I loved the "husband and housewife" -interplay between "Jack" and "Victoria". It was somehow cozy to see a single couple alone in a vast rough environment - together, but separated. There was a distinct air of longing about the whole setup.One of the most memorable (and silliest) moments was when "Jack" rode his motorcycle for a long stretch of desert. Seemed kinda pointless for him to have to use a motorcycle but it was a nice scene otherwise.Which brings me to the music. I loved it. I give the movie 8/10 for the visual style, music and the bitter-sweet chemistry between the main characters.
