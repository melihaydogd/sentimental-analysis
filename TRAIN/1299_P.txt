A Brilliant, Moving Epic
A lot of people see and love King Kong for it's amazing special effects and visual design. They are mind bogglingly good, and the film is an incredibly exciting blockbuster. But what elevates it above the usual mindless entertainment, is that Jackson understands that no matter how much is put into the special effects, at the end of the day what matters most is the writing, story and characters. Jackson pushes all the action back until an hour in the film, taking time to establish the characters before throwing them into it. He does this beautiful, and despite the lack of action it is very engaging, and makes the film seem like an improvement on the original film, because it gives us a reason to care later on. This also builds suspense, making Kong's entrance even more effective. Kong himself is amazing. The CGI work on him is unlike anything the movies have ever seen. Kong's "performance", for lack of a better movie is what makes this movie truly amazing. It's incredibly realistic, and the relationship between him and Ann is completely convincing, and makes for the best scenes in the movie. Jackson makes it as truly involving as any ever seen between two human actors. As exciting and action packed as it is, by the end the most interesting parts of the film are the relationships and growth of the characters, and the final scene is actually an action setpiece that manages to be truly moving at the same time.
