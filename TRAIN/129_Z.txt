Has potential, but really not all that great
THE GOOD: More than a few times, it made me laugh out loud. The humour can be very sharp and silly, both things that I enjoy. <br/><br/>Sometimes they address some interesting philosophical kinds of ideas. It&#39;s got some relatively intelligent writing. It&#39;s got some clear influences from Lovecraft (in more than just the aesthetics, too); and I like Lovecraft.<br/><br/>THE BAD: Rick&#39;s constant burping and stuttering annoys me. <br/><br/>So, so much crass humour - occasionally, it&#39;s kind of fitting &amp; well-played, but for the most part I feel like it&#39;s just a &quot;hey guys, this is an adult show, so let&#39;s make lots of obvious sex jokes!&quot; kind of thing. <br/><br/>Also, the dark side of the interesting philosophical concepts is that it can also come off as preachy, in a self-indulgent, pseudo-intellectual smugness sort of way. Like the writers were all sitting there with their atheist fedoras and neckbeards, thinking of ways to sound deep and nihilistic, and coming up with jokes about religion. It&#39;s really more grating than interesting, overall.<br/><br/>So yeah, this show isn&#39;t entirely bad, but after watching the first season, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll continue.
