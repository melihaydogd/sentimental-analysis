Fun Movie. Worth Seeing.
This was better than I was expecting. The location and sets were awesome. Contained some scares and some laughs. Lots of haters on this one. I'm constantly amused by how many people seem to think that they're the successor to Roger Ebert. Try going to a movie for a fun time, instead of looking for ways to rip it a new one in your lame-ass reviews.
