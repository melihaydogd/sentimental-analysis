The time of my life!
This is a great feel-good movie! Everytime I watch it, I fall in love with the characters all over again, especially Johnny! This may be more of a girl flick than a guy movie, but I think it's a great movie. It may not be one of the most original plots in the world, but the love story is simple and sweet. And the dancing is phenomenal. Makes me wanna get up and do the mambo everytime I watch it! So if you're in the mood for a love story with a bit of sass and some great choreography, check out Dirty Dancing!
