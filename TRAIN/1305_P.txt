Delightful, underrated film
This is one of those underrated films which had a limited release, was not really promoted, and, in my opinion, was dismissed by some as a low-budget, shallow flop because they really did not get the writer's intent. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance, and it is said that he immediately wanted to do the film after reading the script. Sure, it is a lighthearted, feel-good story, but I think a lot of people simply miss the dramatic undertones and the depth. Though not one of my favorite actresses, Evan Rachel Wood somehow manages to capture the character of an exasperated but loving daughter who has had to grow up and take responsibility too quickly because of her absentee parents. Her young life skipped over any fun years and immediately entered the survival mode in which many low-wage, adult workers live because of a lack of education or opportunity due to absentee parents or the socioeconomic situation of their family. Enter her mentally ill, quirky, father, who at first she sees as just another burden. Over time, she realizes he is a sincere idealist struggling desperately to make up for his past mistakes. Her love brings a reluctant willingness to humor him and join in his quixotic search, and ends with an eye-opening realization about her father, life, and the nature of idealism. If you decide to watch it, avoid all possible spoilers!
