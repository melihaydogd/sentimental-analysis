An Honest Review
This is rated "R" and it's hard to believe...but let's face it, scary movies just aren't that scary anymore.

Not that many of them ever were. And even then few have actually provided the constant nightmares of The Exorcist...

But The Conjuring 2 feels like it's going for the PG scares to not lose audiences.

The potential is there, but the director is flying with one hand on the chicken switch and pulls out of everything that's not worse than a jump-scare.

We have the potential for an actual psychologically thrilling horror story here, but its a wasted potential.

Ultimately, like every other horror movie made of late, it seems afraid to actually frighten people.

Still, it's better than the torture porn on the market
