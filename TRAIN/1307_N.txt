Dorm room trauma
One of the most horrible memories I have of college is that in our dorm they seemed to run this movie 24/7. I would go down to the TV lounge to watch something and it would be filled with my peers pajama clad and munching on popcorn and clutching their box of kleenex. It was a constant rotation of Pretty Woman, Dirty Dancing and Can't Buy Me Love. I have night terrors because of it. I hated the movie. I hate Patrick Swayze. I think it goes back to his promotion of the movie as having more substance than Footloose or Flashdance....like saying that cotton candy has more substance than marshmellows. I have to give this movie a 1 to counteract the average of a 5 on this film. I would normally had given it a 3, but the majority of you folks left me no choice. I don't know that this movie inspires anger in me but that time of your life song makes me cower and whimper curled up in a fetal position. The biggest clue that this movie lacked anything interesting, it wasn't in black and white.
