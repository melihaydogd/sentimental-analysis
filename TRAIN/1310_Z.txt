Plagerised crap
This movie is such a complete and utter rip-off of Battle Royale, a real cult classic from Japan. The author of the Hunger Games should be stripped of every cent they made from this movie and the books. Poor acting, BORING story and the costumes are horrible! They actually make the beautiful Elizabeth Banks revolting to the point that it takes away from what movie there is actually to watch. Only reason I didn't give it a 1/10 was because Jennifer Lawrence is pretty good. I'd rather watch Battle Royale and Battle Royale II a hundred times that watch this again. Even the following books/movies are ripped from Battle Royale II, where the kids revolt against the system.
