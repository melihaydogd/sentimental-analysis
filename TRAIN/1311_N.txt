Tedious predictable boring film
Went to see it with high expectations and wished I hadn't bothered. The film was slow and dull with 1 dimensional characters and rubbish story that could've been an old Twilight Zone episode of the sixties lasting 30 mins. The so called horror gory bit near the end wasn't unexpected. Unoriginal. Guy next to me fell asleep and several walked out. Wish I had.
