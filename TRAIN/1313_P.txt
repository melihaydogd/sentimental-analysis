Tarantino's first & best.
I had started and stopped this film many times before actually sitting down and watching it all the way through. After sitting through it, I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>The film was composed beautifully. Instead of a simple plot line, it was broken up and rearranged making the audience work until the end. The music and character transitions were perfect.<br/><br/>Tarantino did a great job making the characters true to the people portraying them. Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. White could have not been more perfect to their characters. The sheer fact that I hated and loved the various characters almost to a point of them being real is a feat in it of itself.<br/><br/>I felt that the profanity was a bit much and it may be necessary to the plot and emotions, but at times it was a bit overbearing.<br/><br/>Overall though, I was very impressed by the rawness of the story and how developed all of the characters were. Amazing!
