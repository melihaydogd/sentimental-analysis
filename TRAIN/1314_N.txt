Showed promise but then it went belly up.
This movie had me interested for about the 1st 30 min. Sure I could see the Similarities to red dawn, (perhaps that is where Some of the inspiration for this more came from), And I was prepared to look past the ridiculous way in which the aliens technology permitted them to see, However I had to turn off after the movie apparently jumped a couple of months, Band the mango farmer, had suddenly turned military specialist and was training the group in military tactics. The dialouge was just plain awful to the point of making my skin crawl. I gave it 3 as they tried to do something different in Australian film.
