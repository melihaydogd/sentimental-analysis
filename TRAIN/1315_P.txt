Visually and emotional dazzling
The story is often hard to digest as a lot of the plot is seemingly unrealistic and the editing at times is unbearably awkward to follow. That being said, there are moments where the film is ripe with sentiment and emotion. The scenes in the booth are mesmerizing and as a viewer, I just wanted to yell at the screen to tell Travis what to do.  The film is beautifully shot and Wenders captivates us with his choice in setting and the medium-long shots of vast Texan landscapes. There is a nostalgic charm to these settings that intrigued me more than anything else in the movie. The dialogue was just as "lost" and off-beat as the characters in the movie.
