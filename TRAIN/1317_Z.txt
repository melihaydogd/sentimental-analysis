Overrated. It's OK, relatively entertaining, but never is it great.
Maybe I was expecting a little too much here, but dammit if this wasn&#39;t one of the most disappointing movie experiences I&#39;ve ever had.<br/><br/>Although Quentin Tarantino has done some cool stuff, I think he is one of the most overrated directors out there.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some cool scenes in Reservoir Dogs, but you know, the feeling I was left with after the credits rolled was: was that it? I was waiting for all this awesomeness to come, but I didn&#39;t see much of it. Their names are maybe the coolest thing in the whole movie.<br/><br/>It looks good considering the low budget and being Tarantino&#39;s debut, but mostly it&#39;s just OK. And that god damn &quot;Tarantino-dialogue&quot; that everyone can&#39;t stop yapping about, what is so great about it? I find it more annoying than anything else.<br/><br/>Btw, just to make it clear: I love violence, I don&#39;t mind movies that lack plot, and I don&#39;t mind style over substance. What I do mind is boring movies.<br/><br/>Maybe if I didn&#39;t know anything about this before I saw it, or didn&#39;t know what I was seeing, whatever, I would have enjoyed it more, but that wasn&#39;t the case. It is what it is, man!
