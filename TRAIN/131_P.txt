A movie you can enjoy with your kids
First off the movie is made to entertain children. That's the target audience. My 6 and 8 year olds loved it, constantly laughing thru the movie. Yes it was a simple plot but that's all that was needed to entertain in this film. It's core is not meant to make you think about world issues or challenge society today, it's to entertain children which I think worked very well.
It's based on a cartoon so you expect many 2D characters, they are there for the main pair (Yogi and Boo Boo) to work off. As someone who grew up with the Yogi cartoon I actually enjoyed it as well. I've gone to well rated adult comedies with far less laughs than this, and its great to see your children smiling and laughing.
It's also nice to be able to see something you can sit and watch with your children without fear they will get the bad language, name calling and sexual references. Silly antics yes, but do you expect more from the original cartoon? If you expect an Oscar nominee, then pass this film by. If you can be young again and allow a film to purely entertain, give it a go.
