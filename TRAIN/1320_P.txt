Amazing
I had seen Akira a number of times a few years back, and watching it again just two days I can't tell you how enthralled I was watching it. The animation is beautiful and very detailed with a wide range of colours that are extraordinary to watch, and the score was phenomenal, it stirred many emotions inside of me. Just like the storytelling that was thrilling, shocking and heart-breaking did, likewise with the use of sound, the silence was even more haunting and intense than those scenes with sound, the excellent dialogue, characters that are developed so well(for a character-driven film you'd expect that, the main characters' conflict is especially well done) that you do root for them and a message that I highly appreciate and don't feel it's over-didactic. All in all, amazing, a real landmark for not only anime but also animation in general.
