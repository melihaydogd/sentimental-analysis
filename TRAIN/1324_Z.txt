Strictly Average
I like Anna Faris and her movies but this one is particularly average. Theres some funny moments but limited. The male lead is old and has no chemistry with Faris. He is dull in many parts. They should have included more funny parts as the movie was beginning to go a little downhill past halfway.The inclusion of spanish or foreign language disjointed the movie in parts and felt like was watching a totally different movie.Strictly Average with some light moments.
