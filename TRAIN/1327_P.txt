Amazing concept
"The Old Guard" (2020) was a first very pleasant surprise in cinema in this disastrous 2020. I did not read of heard any synopsis prior watching "The Old Guard" (2020) and boy did this movie surprised me. I simply loved the concept, when i was revealed. For me the concept itself carried this movie. I wasn't that blown away by action in this movie which was pretty good by itself, but i liked the idea so much that i would love for characters to simply sit and just talk and teorise about the main concept, which i won't spoil. "The Old Guard" is like "The Highlander" meets "The Man from Earth" but with much bigger budget.

Overall, i liked the concept of this movie very much. I would love to see a sequel. I would love to see what happened to the character which was thrown to the bottom of the sea. "The Old Guard" is one of the more original films in 2020 and one of my very favorites.
