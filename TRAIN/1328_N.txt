Disturbing
As a movie, it's boring. As a story, it glorifies a questionable man and deals with a sensitive theme without any delicacy. The benefit of the doubt about the morality of Kevorkian's actions is gone with patient number 1: no way she was terminal, she was just diagnosed with Alzhaimer and still very fine. Secondly, the closing speech of the judge is all you have to know about how law works in a civil society. This movie is a despicable piece of political propaganda, rather than a well-rounded presentation of the theme of euthanasia.
