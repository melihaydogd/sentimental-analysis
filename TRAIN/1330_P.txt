Its a demo for visual effects
Peter Jackson is a great Director, and if you don't know him, just remember "Lord of the Rings". It was the greatest movie ever been made. But here the point was completely different, it is a remake of a well known story. I think that there is no one who likes watching movies didn't see the 1933 or 1967 productions of the story.

So the point here was not an evaluation of the story, I entered the cinema to watch Peter Jackson's view to the story.

the first 30 min of the movie was completely pointless and can simply be removed without affecting the movie at all, just cut em and don't change anything else. I was helpless during this period but being bored and waiting for the actors to start their journey to the Kong Island.

From this point I won't discuss the story, we already know what is going to happen, so Peter was focusing on showing how every thing happens. I felt that the script was tailored to include as many animated objects and visual effects, even if the seen doesn't need all these effects. And in the same time many of the shots were totally obvious to be unreal, like the dinosaurs chase and the fight of Kong and the dinosaur. Peter used the technique of shaking the camera a lot (shake the camera so the watcher becomes unable to see what is really going on). The bugs scene was fine and the Kong in theater was fine too but once we reached the part with the airplanes attacking him it became another visual effects demo. No more comments

The sound is great and the sound effects were awesome, actually these effects were the main reason for me to enjoy the film.

If you plan to watch the movie, here is what to do if you love watching computer graphics go ahead if not, watch the 1976 edition, you will like it more if you ended up in the cinema don't forget to sleep for first 30 min.
