Solid cartoon laughably overrated by a cancerous fanbase of loser 12 year olds and cringe worthy man-children
Sums it all up right there.<br/><br/>It&#39;s good, not life changing.<br/><br/>It&#39;s not The Simpsons, not South Park, not Futurama, not American Dad, not Archer, etc etc etc. But it&#39;s fairly good overall (for an Adult Swim show) <br/><br/>Shame about its embarrassing &quot;hardcore&quot; fanbase and all the beyond pathetic stuff they&#39;re constantly doing which is documented all over the internet.<br/><br/>7/10
