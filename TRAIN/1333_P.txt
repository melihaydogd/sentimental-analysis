We need original franchises for women
Compared to other "Oceans" films, this one is boring with no chemistry amongst the cast. Lazy plot. I find it insulting that Hollywood won't create original content for women. Instead of giving the ladies a franchise once it's dried up and unimportant, how about giving them good writing and NEW characters to work with? Substitute ghostbusters and crap like this doesn't work. We need FEMALE centered pop culture icons, not just substitutes for the guys.
