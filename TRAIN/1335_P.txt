Wakanda Forever
Black Panther is a worthy installment to MCU. The movie truly succeeds as a movie basing on the hero after being first introduced in Civil War thanks to very solid writing that has given a great story and a ton of entertaining and intense action. The characters are likable too. And it has features beautiful visuals and cinematography that brought Wakanda to life. I won't spoil anything, but the final battle has demonstrated its message against hatred. If you're a true Marvel fan that would like to see Black Panther part of MCU, definitely go check it out. I would honestly say this is one of the better movies from MCU. Rest In Peace, Chadwick.
