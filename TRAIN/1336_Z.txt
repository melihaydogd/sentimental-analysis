'Merica
The film as a whole is utter face-numbing drivel. It couldn't be anymore up it's own backside. It plays up to the American ideal so much that it felt like some-kind of recruitment ad for the US military. The characters, each and everyone are a shallow cliché. I see many reviews claiming the film to be the next Die Hard, it's not. Die Hard is responsible for many action film clichés but what made Die Hard special for me at least, was the reluctant hero who is out of his depth but pushes and quips his way to victory.The writing is is hammy, despite the pretty cool premise the film is marred by a seemingly inept good guys who manage to some how let a huge plane fly right over the most important building in the US. This is then followed by highly trained special agents running into the line of fire and government officials making continually bad decisions.Poor film.
