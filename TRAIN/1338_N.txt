I don't have the motivation to keep watching.
The first fight scene is too long. A battle scene or an action scene is boring to watch unless you know why the main characters are fighting. Moreover, these scenes were shot in close proximity with a wide angle camera. It's a very realistic shot, but if it used in the first scene, the director looks drunk and the audience gets cold feet. Secondly, the name of the antagonist is not good. When I thought the atmosphere of the film resembled "Aguirre's Wrath of God", I was shocked to listen the name of the protagonist, the title of Herzog's other masterpiece. This is one of those places where the director is drunk on his own, and that's why he does this. Next, there's a bear. This bear doesn't bite at all and doesn't attack with its claws. The film has been shot in such a way that you can see how it's doing. This is where the director's incompetence comes into play. The bears bite, so he had to prepare a doll to show the bear biting, and he had to deal with it well so that you wouldn't find out that he wasn't biting. As the story progresses, the antagonist becomes clearer and clearer, but this antagonist is too small fish character. The antagonist needs to be a bit bigger and more human to be interesting. It makes me feel fed up that the story is going to progress to defeat this antagonist. Overall, I would have to say that this is a low level work.
