American Unperversion
I can't believe I haven't seen this film earlier. The mood of this is very similar to "American Pie" and "Road Trip", but in this case, a girl is the protagonist. Priscilla is a virgin girl who believes in sex only after marriage; she doesn't drink, party or have sex. She has a boyfriend that pretends to be as pure as she, but in fact he has sex with another girl. So, Priscilla accidentally drinks alcohol and a producer of porn movies films her dancing top-lessly-- but in the end, she founds out that it wasn't her in the video. Throughout the story Priscilla mentions a girl who is the writer of a book called "Don't rush on love" and states to be virgin, but also, near the end, Priscilla finds out that this writer called Mary Margaret is actually having sex Priscilla's boyfriend. The whole film is pretty funny, even thought appealing for easy jokes at times. Better than that, it has a plainly message in the end-- human-being is an hypocrite race.
