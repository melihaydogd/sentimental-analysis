Pretty dull
Maybe I just don't get it or maybe you have to be in the banking industry to care but it's very boring. It's literally just guys talking to each other and about money the entire length of the film- like a radio talk show. The acting is fine and it's not poorly done at all- it's just basically nothing to see. I kept waiting for something to kick in- story, characters- something! I hate to be a snob about it but honestly I just can't imagine how a film like this actually gets made. I mean what was the inspiration?? Who is the intended demographic?? Again, maybe it's just me and I'm hung up on films with action, interesting characters and a colorful story and setting, but I can't even squeeze hard and push out something cool to say about this film. I really wish I could. It's like expecting a rock concert and getting to read a newspaper instead.
