Long Sitcom With No Laugh Track
I suppose Scorcese's name meant this was supposed to be a good movie. He hates comic book movies but at least they're entertaining. This was a 97 minute sitcom without the laughs or the laugh track to let us know something funny happened.

The main character met a girl, went to her house in SOHO, and the next thing he knows he's out of money and can't get home. After his miserable date all he wants to do is get home but one mishap after another keeps him hostage in the SOHO district all night.

Like I said, it would have been better if it was at least funny because it wasn't all that creative.
