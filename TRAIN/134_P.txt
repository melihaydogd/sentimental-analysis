Exceeds Expectations...
Immerse yourself in a not uncommon story of a women fighting an aggressive and violent male predator, where the assaults can come out of the blue and for little or no reason or justification. Outstanding lead from Elisabeth Moss in a genuinely suspenseful piece of cinema with a refreshing perspective on a tried and tested theme.
