Intelligent movie
I don't understand all the hate that "Noah" (the movie) is getting. Personally, I think it is a GREAT movie. But maybe it's because I'm an artist, so I understand what art is and isn't supposed to be. Seems as if a lot of people -especially Christiansâ€“ thought they were going to see a documentary or a theological disputation. I actually think it sticks very well to the Biblical account. Maybe people don't know their Bible as well as they think they do. --- If you don't like the story, how's that the movie's fault? Fallen angels, giants, genocide, etc. is all in the Bible. --- Yes, I'm talking about the actual Bible, not the version you were taught in Sunday school, when you were five years old.

Anyway, if you are at all philosophically inclined and don't mind movies that make you think about serious and even existential questions, ignore the haters; Go see "Noah"!

I haven't been so emotionally moved and intellectually stimulated from a movie for quite a while. It's not for the weak of heart. After all, it's a story about genocide. But it is beautifully made. And, in my opinion, stays true to the Biblical account.
