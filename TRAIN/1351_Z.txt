Really disappointing
After the fuss about this I was expecting a well-paced, heart-warming, mesmerising film, but frankly I was bored rigid, as were the rest of the family. The dances are passable for your average amateur production (and I've seen amateur productions with much better) but a homage to Astaire and Rogers (or even a second rate 50s musical) they're not. A bit of hopping about and swinging her round and that's your lot. The music is pleasant enough but instantly forgettable. Plot? Well, you follow two pleasant enough but essentially bland characters for a while. She swears she will always love him then finds someone else without a backward glance. He gets to play his jazz. That's about it. But because it drifts through with all the dynamism of a spaced-out sloth it takes AGES!
