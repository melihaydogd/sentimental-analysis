Putting the album to imagery, lends the music a whole new depth and conduit for enjoyment
I'm sure before seeing this movie I've listened to the whole album of The Wall. It's kind of incoherent and boring. Granted, it's filled with a whole bunch of great and beautiful songs, but there's too much filler and the story is given no chance at really being told, seeing as the lyircs as ridiculously metaphorical and internalized. The movie, however, puts images and words to the music and what it is that they were trying to say not only makes sense but is enhanced and you really get to see the power and raw emotion in this terribly yet beautifully tragic story about internal descent. The story behind the movie is: Our protagonist is a rock star, whose tragic life and personal excess has been getting to him, eventually leading to a reflection of his memories, eventually leading to him imagining himself as a fascist dictator. The "Wall" refers to a wall he figuratively built around himself to psychologically protect himself. With obsession over parental figures and the horrors of war, you'd have to imagine that this movie would be perfect for psychological education.   The format of the film is a series of either painfully realistic or surreal or both sequences shown with the song that that would represent it in the album. The production values are at times inconsistent, but the power of the film as a whole is amazing. This really is an piece art at its best. The album is the soundtrack to the movie.
