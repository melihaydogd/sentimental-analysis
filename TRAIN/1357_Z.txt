Not that bad
Since its release I was avoiding this movie because of its bad reviews. However I watched it out of boredom recently, and I must say, I wonder why it was rated THAT bad.

Sure it's no masterpiece, but in my honest opinion it at least deserves to be called 'nice'.

The film draws a slightly different image of Catwoman. But thats okay. This is not supposed to be the story of Selina Kyle after all. Patience Phillips is in many regards quite unlike Kyle, so it would only be natural for this Catwoman to differ significantly from the original one.

The one thing I am criticizing the most is, that the plot has to less time to unfold. Everything seems a bit rushed. That's a common illness to movies of the 21st century. But I don't think CGI was used all too much. It is allowed to use some modern technology after all, isn't it?

And for the closing: I have no idea how Halle Berry got that 'worst actress' Razzie Award. She might have overacted some prancing on the rooftops. But to me that's just cartoon, and to be smiled on amused. 'Yes Kitty you ARE a Feline Femme Fatale.'
