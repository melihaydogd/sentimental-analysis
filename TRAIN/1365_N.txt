Awful writing
It's not often I don't manage to plow trough a movie, but the writing on this one was undoubtedly the worst I have seen in a long time.The bafflingly horrible dialogue and characterization was insulting for a viewer with even a shred sense. Was this a film student project gone horribly awry? In a character driven movie, you'd think there would be at least a little effort made on the way characterization. Basically what this movie boils down to is the scenery with a cheesy plot, even worse dialogue and no real heart or mind behind it. Cheap money grab form dimwits to dimwits.If I absolutely would have to say anything good about it, is that most of the shots where in focus.
