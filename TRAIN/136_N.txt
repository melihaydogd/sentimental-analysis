Probably The Worst In Years
Everything good that you've read about this movie is wrong. This is true what Armond White of National Reviw said - this is a shallow rendition of serious racial slur topic on to a Tarantino-type idiocy with all its worst traits, and a deeper delving into a very sleazy and outwardly silly moss of dullness, tedium, drag, plod, endless F-words, endless slow pacing and very midget message, which all was lost in mire and drabness and woven with webs of tepid boredom. Avood this awful flick at all costs, and believe me - hatdly ever had I seen a more shallow and skinted wry fest of weak rants and totally blank shooting with zero results.
