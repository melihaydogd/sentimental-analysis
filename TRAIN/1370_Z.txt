Want to kill time - you could watch this or do something better!
Ideas taken from so many other films/series - i.e. Independence Day/Fallen Skies but with Ozzie accents. Some truly awful acting. And why most of the time do we have to 'humanise' aliens - oh wait.. they have four fingers, not five - my bad! It's low budget (I'm guessing) so don't expect too much. It did entertain me for a couple of hours - I've seen far worse.
