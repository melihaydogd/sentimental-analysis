Most Emotional Movie
I was enchanted by this film, musical films are not my favorite genre, but this film struck me immediately, I thought it was famous only for the presence of John Legend, instead it has a secondary role. I think the storytelling is perfect, it keeps you attached to the screen for the duration of the film. The songs and choreographies are simply gorgeous. I think it's perfect from start to finish, starting with an incredible long take and ending making you cry. The photograph has goose bumps colors. The direction and editing perfect. This is a film that you can watch over and over again, every time you you are surprised more and more, after 5 minutes of viewing it has become an instant cult for me, as soon as the 1st vision is over it has become my favorite film and every time vision is even more so. Thanks to Damien Chazelle, who after 'Whiplash' and 'Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench' gave us another extraordinary film and I hope it can continue like this.
