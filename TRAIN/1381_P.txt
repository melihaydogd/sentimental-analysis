(not sure why it's called primal fear)
I saw this film a few days ago. Was quite impressed. I've thought about it some more since then, and it's occurred to me that it's clever on some other levels.  Richard Gere is the big name, but Edward Norton is the star of the show.  Now when I initially saw it, it occurred to me that Edwards character had pulled the wool over everyones eyes, and got away with murder.  But the reason he committed the murder, was abuse by the catholic church. Now...is that a "justifiable" reason for murder, and rather than justice being dodged (going to jail for murder), has (mob) justice actually been carried out...?
