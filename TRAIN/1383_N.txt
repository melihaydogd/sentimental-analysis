Loved the movie, but can't recommend it. SPOILER ALERT!!
For many of the same reasons that other reviewers have given, I really enjoyed this movie. It creeped me out in the Kubrick-y way that I'd hoped it would, and the score was amazing.However I was really turned off by Glazer's conscious decision to film a screaming, apparently terrified baby on a rocky beach in the middle of the night with waves crashing and roaring just feet away, just to up the queasiness factor.Crew members had to have been nearby, of course. And without having been there, I can't prove the baby was terrified. Hell, I'm not a parent. Maybe he just needed a diaper change.But Glazer himself had this to say on the scene in an interview with TimeOut:Q: There's a powerful scene with a baby abandoned on a wintry beach. How was that to film? A: 'When we filmed that scene, the crew looked at me like I was f**king poison. But that was the scene. It's a baby abandoned on a beach. We feel empathy because we're humans. But how does she (the alien) see it? Not as we do. We've never had that moment of a green Martian coming here in a spaceship. This is how we measure the gulf between her and us.'So, Jonathan Glazer, a terrified baby was the only vehicle you could come up with to convey the alien's lack of empathy? You were fresh out of ideas that didn't involve scaring the hell out of a terrified child too young to verbalize his thoughts on the script? (Oh wait, he WAS verbalizing his thoughts -- by crying his lungs out!!)Full disclosure: Even after the baby scene, I remained through the end credits. But in the 30 hours since, I've felt increasingly ill at ease that I did so. There should never be reason to victimize a child just for the sake of film-making.Otherwise, great story, concept and score. Very unsettling and creepy. Wish I could watch it again. But I won't. And I won't recommend it to friends.
