Fair Game is an accurate portrayal of the government's self-interest
Fair Game is supposedly the next up-and-coming JFK type of movie, where we get to take a hard look at controversy and conspiracy. As expected, the movie deals in some very complex jargon and can be difficult to follow. As we get further and further into the movie I began to accept the fact that I was not going to be entertained, and that I was going to learn something about how our government operates, which I did. This happened rather quickly, and I adjusted to the movie playing out more like a doucmentary with highly-skilled actors rather than something like Air Force One.The 2 main characters become exposed and branded as traitors by their own US Government and find out what it is like to be all by themselves in the fight against a large impersonal entity. White House officials discredit Joe Wilson's (Sean Penn's) account of the government falsifying information to justify invading Iraq. The abuse of power discovered by these characters is pretty incredible, when you have a government that will say practically anything to protect its public image. Lots of drama and fact-finding ensues, and the movie is both compelling and infuriating at the same time. The dialogue is mature and smart, and we draw close into the lives of the married couple, who like diamonds, seem to be able to strengthen their marriage through the trials of pressure.Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) and Joe Wilson (Sean Penn) are the married couple, Plame a CIA agent who's identity is exposed, and Wilson who wrote the controversial but truthful piece which lead to the government's destruction of their lives, or at least the attempt. The validity in Wilson's story is apparent by how much uproar and backlash is caused when the government goes public with their side of the story.
