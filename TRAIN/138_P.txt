Heart warming and enjoyable movie.
Don't get caught up in the title and the basis of the story, its just a movie but one worth watching. The photography and acting are good enough to pull you out of your reality momentarily and into this fantasy world if you let it. The real plot of the movie is innocents believing in something that the common adult mired in fear can't believe and so wants to expose things that challenge their safe reality as fraud or delusions. However, adults who can look beyond their own fear of the unexplained and embrace the wondrous diversity of life beyond what our senses can explain and with respect, can open new realities and new understanding. They have faith and vision and live in a world were thought becomes reality, through respect for all things, and believe in the joy of creation and discovery.
