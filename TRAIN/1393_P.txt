Since The Matrix (1999), The Best Sci-Fi Flick I Seen So Far.
How it is even possible, that I was 1 year searching for a Sci-Fi movie to watch and I didn't found this!

For first time I get in touch with this movie yesterday, when I was looking for something to watch. Because I didn't like Tom Cruise so much so I wasn't much looking forward to see this, but It was the best thing I could do.

The film hold my attention from first second till the end. I didn't found any part of the movie boring. Every single dollar invested to this flick was seen in every part. I didn't get the end so much, but I think that's the thing, that the film makers intended.

In conlusion, it was the best sci-fi I seen since The Matrix.

I 1000% recomend to anyone to see this extra-class movie!
