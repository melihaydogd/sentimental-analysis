Great story but worst acting.
Story is about a crime reporter who is in love with his ex-girlfriend but there is another girl who is very obsessive for him. Basically, a cocktail of sex, suspense, and thriller. According to me, Storyline of the movie is very good, I mean, awesome climax (could be more elaborated but bus good anyway). Acting was very dull and we can even notice the weak direction. It could be made even better if the star cast would have chosen from good theaters. All over Zid is made to launch Mannara who can not do acting at all (as per this movie). Sensual scenes were good. Director knew the people's psychology about intimacy. There were some geographical errors and continuity was missing. My Ratings are as follows Acting and star cast: 2 SStory is about a crime reporter who is in love with his ex- girlfriend but there is another girl who is very obsessive for him.
