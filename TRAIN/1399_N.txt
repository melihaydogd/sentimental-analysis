Kill this movie!
This film is boring from the beginning to the end. Well, I confess I did not see him fully! I passed it forward several times because I couldn't take it. The sex scenes with Radcliff will hunt me forever. I guess I won't be able to look at him the same way as I used to do with harry potter. He grown up the worse way. The theme is deplorable. No way this argument could deliver a work of art (like you assume the 7th should be). In one word: presumption The worst movie i watched this year. Again I can't understand why I have to go on writing this review when all I want to say is: escape this one. Someone should have told me that!
