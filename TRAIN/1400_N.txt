Pathetic portrayal of what is wrong in Indian society
Do not understand the need to promote what should be completely vanished from indian society.

Story of Akshay , mumma's boy is the worst of the kind. Spineless boy, parents expecting girl to be like a mindless,meak robot .. what could be more worst?

And overall show promoting ideas that girls should adjust everything, showing independent girls in bad light..while happily promoting /accepting demanding parents of boys is just horrific..

Glad not most indians think the way it is shown in the show
