Fantastic start, but gets dull later on.
Yes, I know this is based on real even bla bla bla, but movies should be entertaining or make you think or moralise or whatever. Anyway, the first half got me interested, the acting was fantastic and the story was interesting, the characters were great, sadly the last half hour is really dull, it looks like a giant period of time was showed in a few minutes, the ending is cheap, felt like important moment of film, but done in quick way like a low budget weak writting movie would do. I wish they expanded the last arc a lot.
