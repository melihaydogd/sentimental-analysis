As a true Austen lover, having read the book and seen the amazing 1995 series, the only positive thing I have to say about this absolute horrid failure of a film is that the music was quite nice. Every possible thing was wrong with this film, the script, the language, the setting and most of all...the actors, my god, is that Matthew McFadyen supposed to be at all handsome and powerful? He look like a bloody wimp! And Keira....love her in all her movies, but she....she should have stayed away from this. It takes a real woman to play Elisabeth Bennet! I don't understand why they made a remake of it, when the 1995 series is absolutely perfect? It is completely ludicrous!
