A genius mix of emotion, comedy and sci-fi!
Rick and Morty is a hilarious new show by the genius behind Community seasons 1-3 and 5, Dan Harmon. The episodes so far have always seemed fresh and the writing is hilarious and creative. But then there&#39;s no surprise really since its co-creator created Community.<br/><br/>The hilarious mixture of wittiness, slapstick and action all add to making this show one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.<br/><br/>From what I&#39;ve seen so far, the show easily parodies different movies and topics, also slyly sneaking in references (sometimes not slyly).<br/><br/>The art also is simple, but very appealing. Because the show is animated, Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland and the writers have been able to break free from the chains of live action, making the show more out of this world.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this show to anyone, especially fans of the Regular Show, Adventure Time and Community.
