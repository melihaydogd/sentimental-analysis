Made the way superhero movies should be!
A team of heroes, theri story told with an enthralling set piece showcasing their powers, then a segue immediately into a story. Sound exciting? It is, and, if it were not for the insistence on wallowing in long shots of "name" actors, superhero movies could be this way to!

It is a little too adult in parts - the female guinea pig's romantic playing of her two male colleagues and some pet shop scenes among others - but this signs the cheque that lesser films like 'Cats vs.Dogs' and 'Snow Dogs' promised, mainly by weaving the fact the animals can talk into a major plot device.

Better than both 'Fantastic Four' movies, with a more credible and better rounded villain than most "adult" action movies, this is a winner!
