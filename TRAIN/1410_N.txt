Boring
I love period pieces it is my favorite genre. Especially from WWI, WWII, Korea, Japan and China. This movie seemed like the perfect fit for my tastes. I was very wrong. I stopped this movie at 57 minutes and refused to watch anymore. I do understand what the director was trying to do on him not wanting to kill. However the execution failed miserably. The movie had beautiful scenery, the costumes and setting were perfect. The camera was terrible for any scenes with extensive movement. It was reminiscent of the zombie movie Rekill where I got vertigo trying to watch it. I personally think the critics got this very wrong. It's why I don't trust critics.
