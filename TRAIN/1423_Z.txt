Not even remotely as good as Spinal Tap...
It is funny, Spinal Tap had much better music and was a fake (then real?) joke band. A cautionary tale about rock and roll bands, sure... but we know how rockers acted in the past. We were all bored stiff half way in...ughh. If you are a fan then great, see it. Otherwise, try to catch a documentary of a more relevant band, not a single person we know has ever heard of any these songs by this group. The production by Netflix was sufficientl, but the material brutally inconsequential. We do wish them all well in their retirement.
