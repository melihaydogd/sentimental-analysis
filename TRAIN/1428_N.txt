A nothing movie
This is one of those nothing movies, that a handful of people into art-house kind of stuff might love, but no-one else will.There is no plot. It's a string of loosely linked scenes and random effects, often drawn out, and rarely with any dialogue, in which a woman holds very fake-sounding dialogue with various sleazy guys to lure them to her home, except for a sicko rapist who seems to be offered up as the hero of the story!!!?!? A few people will claim that there is deep meaning in this movie and that people need to be insightful and deep-thinking to see it. The truth is, that can be said for any semi-randomly jammed together series of images. Human minds naturally try to make sense of randomness. Doesn't mean a movie that plays on that takes skill, time or effort to make, and certainly doesn't make it 'intelligent'.
