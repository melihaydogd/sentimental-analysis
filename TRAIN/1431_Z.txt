Hardly worth the money
Well, the story is just dull. I simply find it as normal as it gets and totally predictable. The fact that Po just simply find a way to realize the marshal art by 'thinking' about it and call it destiny is none-sense. For any marshal art, the worriers need to practice and maybe in older age, they will find inspiration so they can realize the true arts and have the break through. Otherwise, you are some kind of genius and very suitable to practice marshal art and learn something from special scroll or something, then you can learn the true art. In the first movie, at least ShiFu somehow find a way to train Po so he becomes strong in the end. Still ridiculous but acceptable. In the second story, that part of the story is just so thin and Taichi just suddenly fall in onto the lab and he becomes the master of itÂ…. OK, if you just simply for a laugh and try to watch the cute panda, it is OK. However, what you have not seen in the second movie that is not in the first one? The story is not funny anymore, Panda is the same as before and the whole thing really just rushed all way to the end. The parents-son relationship is pretty thin as well. I really enjoyed the first movie and now I find the second one a disappointment. Again, watch in big screen may give the movie a few positive point and really no point to watch it again on small screen.
