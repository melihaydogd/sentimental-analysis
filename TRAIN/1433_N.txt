Is that all there is?
This was just a well-photographed variation on CHINATOWN. The story was too contrived and needlessly complicated. Cleaning up the storyline would have cut forty-five minutes from the bloated running time. And why wasn't James Cromwell nominated for Best Supporting Actor? His work was the highlight of the whole film. The low point was Kim Basinger's way over-rated performance. There was more acting done by the excellent costumes than by Ms. B. She was adequate, but didn't do anything with the part that a dozen other actresses could have done.
