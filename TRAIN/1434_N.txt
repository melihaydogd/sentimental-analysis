Meh
I was really looking forward to watching this movie.But, the first 1/3 of the movie was completely boring and I struggled to get engrossed with the characters.The movie seemed more stupid than funny. I'm happy if there's a balance, but it seemed awkward and just plain unfunny with everything altogether.
