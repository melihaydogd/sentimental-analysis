Meyer's Angels
Three well-endowed strippers race! kill! and kidnap! - resulting in an ample female foursome. Their "screenplay starts to unfold," according to star Tura Satana (as Varla), when they meet up with old man in a wheelchair Stuart Lancaster (as The Old Man) and his hunky son Dennis Busch (as Vegetable). They want to find Mr. Lancaster's stash, and check out "the lay of the land." Another son complicates matters and relationships. There are some funny lines - like Ms. Satana mentioning Christopher Columbus to a leering gas station attendant. The best part is when Varla tries to pin Vegetable with her car. Ouch! A lurid trip. **** Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) Russ Meyer ~ Tura Satana, Lori Williams, Dennis Busch
