Horrible, great cast, terribly miscast
I love every major actor in this film. But the miscasting is legendary. Liam Neeson is so badly miscast that you can see him trying to play the part of Hannibal right from the start and doing so in unconvincing fashion. He doesn't fit the part. And Face... sorry, great actor but he's not the ladies man. You know there is going to be a problem when the strongest member of the group is the non-actor - BA. And he's not great. Murdoch... just a total lamer.

The miscasting is evident without seeing the prior history this story has seen. As a remake that didn't need to be remade, it's a disgrace. The IMDb rating is badly overblown and most generously above 6. If you go to other sites you'll see a far lower rating and for good reason. This is unfortunately a poor B movie. Watch at your own risk.

The opening of the film wastes time on a mediocre back story. And then it's padded run time with the team envisioning success needlessly. All the famous lines are used to recreate the characters but so poorly that all you can think is "it's -insert name actor here- artificially uttering the lines made famous in trademark style." The team goes into Baghdad and let the ridiculous bravado begin. Don't say you weren't warned.
