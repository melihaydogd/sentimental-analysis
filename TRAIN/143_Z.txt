Another low quality HK movie
Its the same as those started from 90s in HK that produces more low quality movie to earn more in quantity of movie made. These producers and directors only want to make fast money and did not care of quality. Too bad that few good actors wasted their time and effort. The worst, they wasted consumers money and time watching these craps, thinking the having good actors resulted movie are good but the truth is reverse. A lot of the story are so nonsensically illogical. They also created too much coincidences that never will happen in life. Overall, bad story, bad director and a lousy movie compared to China and HK movie.
