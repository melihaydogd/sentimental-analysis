An enigma
One of those classics that earned their reputation at a time when character development was an excuse for lacking in everything else, including a title that actually makes sense. As I am catching up with quite a few of these old movies I never managed to watch at their time I see a pattern emerging. With Chinatown it's clear within 20 minutes that this is not going to pick up pace and actually care about storytelling. Instead you're supposed to be drawn into the characters. The rest is an incredulous string of events that could go on forever or end right here without making any difference.

I very much appreciate film noir as a genre but this is not film noir. I am aware that I'm in the minority here but the boredom that this movie creates deserves no more than two stars. Good acting though but as said, you should develop characters for a purpose. Enough said.
