"Primal Fear" has a very well-written story which targets a very fundamental question that we all are struggling with in our lives, what is right and what is wrong. Is it justified to do something immoral to achieve a right goal? Almost every character in this movie is dealing with this question and they choose to go in different directions.   My main criticism to the movie is the casting. Richard Gere is playing the main role and Laura Linney is the main actress. They both are very wonderful actors but I believe they were not a suitable choice for the roles in this movie. For example, the character Richard Gere is playing is a passionate, arrogant lawyer that would suite better to someone like Al Pacino or Paul Newman.
