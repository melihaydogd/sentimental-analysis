You will get this movie if you ever had your heart broken
I remember watching this movie for the first time in cinema in 2016 with my friend. I was (and still am) not a huge fan of musicals. I felt that the movie was too long and a bit overrated. I can't say that I disliked it, but I remember leaving the cinema and talking with my friend about it; we were both a bit disappointed, but we still liked the music, the storyline and, of course, the acting. A few years later, I fell in love, and I fell in love deeply. It was a beautiful relationship where me and my significant other mutually shared truly intense love. Sadly, this relationship didn't last but we parted our ways while still loving each other. Then one day, maybe one year after our break up, I watched La La Land again. Boy, did I cry my eyes out. I sat there as the movie ended, thinking how the hell I didn't really like the movie when I watched it a few years back?! This is obviously the greatest movie ever made! I was so moved on the emotional level that the next day I was telling my friends and family members that they have to watch it and they are going to love it. A few of them did, and then told me that they actually didn't enjoy it that much, or that they didn't make it to the end... You can say a lot about this movie: the acting, the music, the scenery... But to me, if you ever deeply loved someone, and for some reason couldn't be with them anymore, this movie hits like no other.
