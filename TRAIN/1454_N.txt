Good performance, but Kim Basinger is overrated
I don't see what the appeal of this movie is for so many people. I didn't think there was any chemistry at all between Kim Basinger and the detective, whose name slipped my mind. There were a few good performances, but not enough to make this movie a classic. For real chemistry, watch "Sea of Love," "The Big Easy" or even "Body Heat."
