Julia Roberts is the ugly duckling?
Movie publicist Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) tries to juggle a crazy director who is holding the movie hostage, and the breakup of the movie's two stars. Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) is terribly jealous of Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones)'s relationship with the weird voiced Hector Gorgonzolas (Hank Azaria). Her last two movies without Eddie has bombed. Lee has to organize a movie junket without anybody seeing the movie. Meanwhile Gwen's dutiful sister Kiki (Julia Roberts) is slowly falling for Eddie.

The script written by Billy Crystal, and Peter Tolan takes a few pokes at the movie business. It has a little fun. Billy Crystal is pushing hard for the material. Hank Azaria is doing another stupid voice and is all the more annoying for it. Cusack and Zeta-Jones have little chemistry or great rom-com chops. But there is one thing above all else that annoyed me the most. I cannot buy that Julia Roberts is the ugly duckling. They try to explain it away with her 60 lbs weight loss. Quite frankly, Julia and Catherine operate in the same area of acting. Julia may be slightly better, but this movie needs two women at the opposite ends. Julia can't really pull this off no matter how charming she is. Now if there is a fatter Julia Roberts with 60 lbs on her, she may be great for this role.
