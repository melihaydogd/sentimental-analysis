Movie sucks
It wasn't a bad movie other than it didn't end with an explanation. So if you like watching a movie with no ending, here you go!! and to save yourself 2 hours just shut the movie off any time you want and it's going to end the same way!!! Anyone that gave this movie any more than 2 stars should check back into the mental hospital for another checkup. For my final thoughts on this movie, well I'd sooner get kicked in the nuts by an NFL kicker than watch this ever again!!!
