A Rich Video game Fan kid tries to make a movie
I don't know how even start how bad this movie is. Dreamworks really approve this? How dare EA just spit on a long time Need for Speed franchise like this.Seriously! From my understanding there is only one answer for that, a very rich video game fan kid asked his daddy for a sweet sixteen present, make a movie. The screenplay is painful and unwatchable, the story make no sense, there is more plot holes than a swiss cheese, the acting ..Wow... aside of the millions of dollars paid to Michael Keaton to explain the obvious throughout the movie, and the hard attempt of the kid from Breaking Bad break into the film industry, the rest are probably all classmates, relatives and random people trying to act. What drives me nuts, is How quite a large and good production (66M), spend not only time but money in a script like that. Predictable, Flat, No sense, Amateur dialog and so on. Bless God I didn't watch this on the theaters otherwise for the first time in my life I would ask for a refund at the box office.
