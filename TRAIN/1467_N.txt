Superficial Man

Utter dross devoid of character, humour and even colour.

The CGI is the usual fantastical & arbitrary nonsense we have all had to endure in modern times - filling out the last third of an overlong movie with a week script so full of holes and non-existent characters it makes you want to weep.

As an utterly superficial entity I imagine nonetheless it will score highly among pre-pubescent kids, ADHD sufferers, dullards and the easily entertained.

Too cool for school, zero expression. Who is Superman?

Even the pretty Amy Adams can't save this one for me!!
