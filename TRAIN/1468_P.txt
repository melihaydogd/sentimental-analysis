I am writing this as a fanboy so in short if you have watch Yu-Gi-Oh's anime in your child hood you will love this movie. If you can watch in high quality, watch it. Worth every megabit. To see all the monsters in high quality is perfect. The vilain is a classic anime vilain but you should watch it for you child hood.
