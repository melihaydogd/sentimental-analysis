Supercowboy is Dead, Long Live The Superhero...
Deglamorising the unfashionable Western genre by the culprit that had reanimated the cadaver some decades previous. Excepting the final shootout, this representation omits the unshootable, the character that could walk through the volley of a dozen Gatling guns and survive. Instead, we're almost treated to something that may be closer to reality but even then, there are leaps of faith and characters that we probably wouldn't recognise in ourselves or those we know, although Clint Eastwood plays himself - he always does, that's why we watch his films.Ultimately it draws a line in the sand, where the heroes of the silver screen replace leather chaps and suede for Lycra and capes - I guess masks are a common theme. Were we sad to see them go? Sooner or later you run out of originality in the real world and, in order to perpetuate something new and engaging, the unreal world is the only place to go, especially when CGI can make it feel so real.
