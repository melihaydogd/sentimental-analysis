1933 King vs 2006 Kong
Having previously bought two edition on Laser Disc of the original 1933 KING KONG I was not intending to purchases the DVD release. When I found out that the recent Kevin Brownlow documentary, "I'M KING KONG! The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper" was included as an Extra I bought it -- and was very glad that I did. The 1933 version had never looked so good. Another Extra was Peter Jackson's recreation of a missing scene in the pit (after Kong shakes the men off the log) that turned out to be a lot of fun to watch. It was also evident that director Jackson loved and respected the original film. So when I saw in the theatre the previews for the 2005 remake I was pleased to see it was very much patterned after the 1933 film. Watching the DVD turned out to be a very pleasant surprise! Jackson has done a marvelous job of technically updating things while adding a dimension to the story that justifies another remake. The relationship between Kong and the girl works in every way. Naomi Watts is much more then just a beautiful girl, she glows with an inner beauty that gives the film emotional depth! She moves from a terrified victim to a person that gradually comes to understand and respect the beast who has risked his life in protecting her. The scene at sunset of Kong meditating after nearly loosing his life battling prehistoric creatures is amazing. As Watts looks into Kong's dark eyes it is as if she becomes aware of a gentle, soulful side of her abductor. Over the course of the film, the girl and the beast come to respect one another -- and it's believable. While the updated special effects and sounds are truly marvelous, it is the human element between beauty and the beast that makes this version of Kong worth remaking. For my money, both versions are worth watching. The 1933 KING and the 2005 KONG compliment each other.
