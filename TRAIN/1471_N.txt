violent yes. good.................
Zombie 90 is a zero budget "movie" made by German director Andreas schnaas. This is the guy who also has a movie series called violent S##t. This is one of those straight to video movies that were very common around this time where anyone could buy a camcorder and make a movie. The special effects arnt completely horrible but thanks to the awful lighting most of the time the blood looks like strawberry milk. I cant judge the dialog writing or acting because the dubbers obviously did not follow the script. At some points you can hear the dubbers LAUGHING. The intentionally bad dubbing is hilarious though and is the only redeeming factor of this movie in my opinion. And to top it off this movie has no ending.( You will have to see it to know what i mean). If you want a few laughs then i recommend this movie but if you want a serious horror movie look somewhere else.
