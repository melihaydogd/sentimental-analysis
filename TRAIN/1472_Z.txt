Not Terrible but Not a Worthy Successor to Dazed and Confused
As a fan of Dazed and Confused, when I found out about this film I was ecstatic but it just doesn't deliver; I really wanted it to be great but it never really gets there. The characters are mostly forgettable and not even overly likable. At times it seems like a bad copy of Dazed and Confused, with lines like "that's what I'm talking' about" repeated and characters such as the coach (who seems like a carbon copy of the assistant coach from Dazed and Confused) and Finnegan (who seems very much like an attempt to replicate McConaughey's Wooderson). It's set in the 80s but there really isn't an 80s experience here like Dazed and Confused delivered. Dazed and Confused gave us a look at the cars and some of the iconic things about the 70s, as well as experiences that gave the viewer a look at what being a teen in the 70s may have been like, but Everybody Wants Some never really delivers any of that. The performances here aren't bad (with the exception of one character who, to me, seemed like a parody) and it's not a terrible movie, it just lacks the magic of Dazed and Confused and in the end it's really just a flat film that never really gets the viewer excited or delivers. Of course, this is just my opinion and you may really enjoy it, so check it out yourself and form your own opinion because it's at least worth seeing once.
