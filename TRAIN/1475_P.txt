By far the BEST Batman movie .
I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie.
