Great Show!
Please don't listen to these ridiculous reviews about the show regarding race. ITS IN THE COMICS! THEY DISCUSSED RACE IN THE COMICS! Or course it's going to be in the show. This is how you know most people leaving reviews are just fans of movies and not the comics. GET OVER IT ALREADY! It's a great show. Great writing. It's answering all the question most REAL marvel fans wanted answers to. Keep up the good work Disney/Marvel!
