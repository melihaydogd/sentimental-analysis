Story was very down to Earth

Even though I've barely gone through any of the situations that the characters have gone through I found that I easily related to all of the situations the characters were going through. I also felt that the audience could also easily relate to the characters emotions as well. In my opinion, the movie was very well done. Everybody should definitely give it a watch if they get the chance.
