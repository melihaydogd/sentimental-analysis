Sub-Par Pixar
Pixar is getting lazy.This movie is the second bland, generic Pixar release this year (the other being "Soul"). Neither of these movies came close to capturing the magic of Pixar at its best -- "The Incredibles," "WALL-E," "Toy Story 3" -- instead falling back on the kinds of meaningless platitudes you might find on those inspirational posters you see hanging on the wall in work places, or those cross stitched messages hanging on the wall at grandma's house."Onward" is the blah blah story about a young man who thinks he's lacking in all these qualities that he then realizes in the course of a journey he's really had inside him all along. All I could think about while watching this movie was the ending of the stage musical "Urinetown," where the heroine tells all the townspeople living in a world without water that the the glass of water they crave has been inside them all along. Then they all die of thirst.Grade: B-
