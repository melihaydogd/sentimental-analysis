Not bad, a little thin on interest level but watchable.
Talking about thin, Matthew did go to the limit with his method acting here. I've seen more meat on a jockey's whip... but that's what he had to do to make an essentially weak film hold your attention. I thought Jennifer Garner was a bit of a cardboard cut out, as were all of the medical staff, but the guys at the bar were pretty convincing. 

Anytime they show Texas in a movie I'm hooked, so I'm going to watch 'til the end, even if the dust turns to mud as it did in the latter parts of this show. The casting guys in Hollywood have drawn a big blank with Feds lately and this gang are just as hollow as the other big movies. Mind you I did work with a lot of them in my time and a lot of them were ungulates like these characters. Could be they did it on purpose. 

Is it just me or are the movies replacing cigarettes with cocaine these days and promoting it as a lifestyle? There must be some sort of policy change going on to legalize it (and collect taxes), as the last three movies I've seen have the protagonists snorting it through garden hoses; American Hustle, The Wolf of Wall Street etc. It seems to be an essential part of any plot if you want it to get on the screen. I must live a very sheltered life because none of the people I know do it... mind you I live in an old people's home! 

So before they bring me my pills I should summarize; Pretty lightweight stuff, we all know that the FDA is a tainted organization but the script could have done a better job with the material at hand. I prefer Matthew in his lawyer or handsome brute roles, this was straying too far from his paydirt. The rest of the cast could have come from one of those CSI shows that I never watch.
