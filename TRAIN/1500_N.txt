Utter Rubbish - Waste of valuable, drinking time!
Eagle eye, film based on killing a particular person. Using every computer or network device, to bring 2 adults who have never met each other, to carry out a crime. This all could have been down in one motion. Plane, Train, car or fire. But noooooooooooooo!

Complete waste of time, and money! So far fetch.

Much worst than the Matrix, at least we knew the matrix is make believe, and never will happen.

This film makes you think, this could happen! Lol

Don't bother watching it.

Car chase is good, and the filming. Other then that, take your nanny or grandpa out for tea, instead. More satisfying!
