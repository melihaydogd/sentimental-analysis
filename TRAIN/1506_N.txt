Ripp Off Of Battle Royale !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CAPS LOCK FOR ADDED EMPHASIS! THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF OF BATTLE ROYALE! And before any of you smart alecks decide to say "how can it be a rip off when its based off a book", the answer is simple:Battle Royale came out in 2000, Hunger Games was published in 2008.Not only that, this isn't even a decent rip off. It has a stupid one sided love story and its just generally a kid friendly Disney-esk Hollywood piece of poop. No seriously, if you think this is even remotely good, then just go watch Battle Royale... seriously. Exactly the same plot, with the exception, Battle Royale is bloodier, has a better story and is based in a real world country (japan) rather than some made up magical land of pixies and clothes that catch fire but don't burn people.I've seen both, Battle Royale is epic, this is just lame.
