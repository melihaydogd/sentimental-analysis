Homer is Still Plow King!
The Simpson's come home to the Big Screen...at last.

Homer is still King with his sheer stupidity, fat pants, and bad eating habits.

The best laugh my whole family has had in a very long time.

People think that the World's Funneist Family should retire. They think that Bart should grow up, Lisa should move to the next grade, Homer should retire and Marge should hang up her knitting needles.

But I ask you this: If Itchy and Scratchy retired then who would the Simpson's watch?

Take this into our lives, yes that's right: the Simpsons' are our Itchy and Scratchy.

If you're one of those people who criticize the Simpsons' saying they arn't good anymore, or whatever the case might be, then shut your mouth and don't pick apart the World's Itchy and Scatchy! It is as simple as that!

Spend your $10 admission and sit back for the summer's funniest movie so far.
