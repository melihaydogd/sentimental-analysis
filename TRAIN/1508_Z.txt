He would die for you
Mike (Johnathon Schaech) and JP (Adrian Grenier) are brothers. Growing up Mike looked after JP. As adults, Mike has a messed up life while JP has a successful life in construction. Mike is mixed with Eddie King (Nicolas Cage) a crime boss with a bad rug. Eddie devises a plan to extract money from JP. John Cusack plays undercover cop Sal.

The drama and dialogue was poor. I am not sure why Cage wore such a terrible rug (see DVD cover) and I couldn't figure out that fake accent that varied from scene to scene. Cusack was only marginally credible. The whole plot reeked. What was good was the slow motion gun shot wounds near the end of the film. Worth passing up unless you really have to see a slow motion shot of a bullet exiting a cheek.
