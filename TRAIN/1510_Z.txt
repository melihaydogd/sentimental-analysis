Too Chaotic To Love or Hate
I feel like Paprika is almost criticism-proof. Any bad thing I have to say about it can be attributed to intention. The dialog is poor, plot points pop out of nowhere, and logic is thrown out the window. But this all seems to be adding to the mood, a dream-like movie that doesn't follow reality.  But I just don't see the point of this accomplishment. Its weird for the sake of being weird...so? That leaves no impression on me. It could have been any random assortment of images and be just as effective. I can't love a movie through mood alone.  At least it was an interesting sit, with fine animation and plenty of bizarre action. If you're into this kind of style-over-subsistence, then you may love it. For me, its more forgettable than amazing.
