Predictable and dull
Cumberbatch played Alan Turing well, but I felt he was given almost same persona as he plays in Sherlock. His mannerisms were almost identical. This is where most of the 'laughs' in the film come from and as I had seen Sherlock before hand 70% felt like dull repeats.The fact that nobody was friends with him just reminded me of Sherlock - this was not true in real life. Secondary, the plot was almost identical to every other movie about a genius - Turring was played as unrecognized and an oddball. The plot also felt too smooth edged, all the twists were predictable and the events were too coincidental to be believable. The spy subplot was unnecessary and added nothing to the story. This may sound pedantic, but some parts seemed out of place for the historical setting: the detective's too modern haircut and lines such as "ohh my gosh" which really brought me out of the story. Finally, the ending scene was unnecessary and should have cut straight to the ending lines. Speaking of which, the last line inferred that the two things mentioned were linked, but they were in fact months apart. This is an example of the film's unreasonable twisting of facts in order to give the plot and conclusion this type of film needed. Should you wish to find out the real story of Alan Turing I suggest you google it as this film is not very accurate and unfairly stereotypes Turring.
