Great Movie- Critics are Dumb-See the Movie
This is a great movie, not overdone. The reason critics are being nasty is because a woman is playing the hero and saving a man and his daughter. The music is great, Jennifer Garner is a great actress, and the special effects and fight scenes are well done and don't look overdone. Go see the movie, it will not be a waste of your money or time. It's only an hour and a half long. Based on the ending it looks like they will be making another one in the future. I heard that Ben Affleck's character Daredevil was supposed to make a cameo in the movie but I didn't see him, did anyone actually see his character in the movie?
