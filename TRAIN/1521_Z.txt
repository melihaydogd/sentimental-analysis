6. only for first steps to revolution of movies visual effects.
Warning: Spoilers
It's way to long movie to watch and enjoy with it. i liked visual effects, it was awesome 17 years ago, but now it's not a big deal, so i have to rate it with 6. story is garbage in my opinion, and there is many mistakes in movie. 2 h and 15 m is too long for this movie, i was bored and almost Falled in sleep in half of movie. there is good action scenes but only in moments and not in whole movie. Im 'not' gonna talk about acting, it was normal except Keanu, i really like Keanu, but he was stupidly confused in this movie, he was exactly like Ted Logan. *SPOILERS* i really didn't liked one scene in this movie, when Neo was almost killed by agent smith, i think he was pretty dead but it does not matters, trinity kissed Neo's body and he came alive?! what the f###? i Think'd i had Deja Vu but then i remind i already has watched snow white and seven dwarfs. i really didn't get it he came alive when trinity kissed him because he was chosen? Im done.
