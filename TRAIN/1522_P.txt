Unfinished Ending!
This is an excellent, if disturbing movie, but why is the viewer left with such an unfinished ending?? What happens to Alex and to Anna's Dad? The film leaves too much unanswered. While I get the irony of both the protagonist and the perpetrator ending up in the same position, the viewer is not given enough to go on to surmise a conclusion. Character development and acting are top notch, as is the set design. The subject though tough to watch, is developed to be believable with some missing pieces, though, such as why when working the final crime scene don't they find all of Anna's Dad's belongings in Alex's mother's kitchen? Some threads are left undeveloped.
