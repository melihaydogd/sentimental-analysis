Life changing experience! Must see!!!!!!!!!
It was the best movie I've ever seen. I wish I was there in the movie. It changed my life, the world's best movie. I want to be the main character (Alex). They should make a sequel or even a series. Dear god I love it. It probably sounds freaky or weird but the movie is me. I was destined to see it. I think that the character Emma was hot, and the other main characters were the best. I will be shocked if you don't love it as much as me!!! I've already decorated everything Echo style. ET lovers, it beats ET! It is better than any movie ever in my personal opinion. I want to meet the cast, and I wish cute little echo was real...

MUST SEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
