if a black Leni Riefenstahl had made a movie it could have been this one
A reality check of mine is always: how does X or Y sound when a religion or race in the statement/book/movie is reversed. This film could NOT have been made, if the black hero had been white and the white villains had been black. It is so stereotyped. Don't get me wrong, it was an intelligent film and a deep, deserved critique of our modern society. It was well-filmed and a good watch throughout. It's just: Leni Riefenstahl also made a cinematically good documentary about some or the other Nazi Olympic games and that is rightly denounced as being racist. This film is a Leni Riefenstahl. Only it has the white guys in the stereotypical villain role. And suddenly its all okay. We're allowed to be racist about white people and call it art. Uhuh. A good film. I enjoyed it. But: No, deeply, disturbing and racist.
