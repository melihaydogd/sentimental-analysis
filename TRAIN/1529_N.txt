Do not watch if you like X-men and Marvel
I fast forwarded through 3/4 of this movie, which I hardly ever do. The start had some promise, but it soon became one uninspired gore-fest in which all you do as a viewer is wonder who dies next. I understand the idea of a raw movie, but in the X-men context this was just an empty shell without any values or any factor that really swept you along. And what a waste of talent for one of my favorites, Patrick Stewart. And the ending just leaves you thinking 'What... that was it?...' I actually had to laugh a little. Glad I skipped though it, otherwise the waste of time would've been bigger.
