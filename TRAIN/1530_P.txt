Great buildup and true to the Ocean family
Sandra Bullock was cool as ice in the buildup with all the 7 fabulous and unique other partners. The million cameos were great too, My only wish would have been a cameo from George Clooney or just a tuxed arm reaching in at the end to toast his sister for her grand heist,
