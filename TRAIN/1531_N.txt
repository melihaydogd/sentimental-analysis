a boring movie
I thought that this movie was an OK movie.  I'm glad they re rated it b/c there are about 8 swear words in it and Charlton Heston's pants come down a few times to only expose his behind nothing else.  I haven't seen the new movie but I thought this one was not worth watching.  This was not a movie the whole family would enjoy.  I know I didn't enjoy it that much. I did like the ending though but it was a little hard to understand.  PLease think before you go and watch this movie
