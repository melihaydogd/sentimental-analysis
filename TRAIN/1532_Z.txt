Just OK
Dirty Dancing is a movie that I literally did not watch until yesterday, many many years after I was born and many many years after it was first released.

I always promised myself that I would never sit down and watch it because I knew what people said about it and the "best parts" to me all sounded pretty stupid, like the famous dance scene and "nobody puts baby in the corner"...

But it turned out to be OK. The music is pretty stupid now but I have to admit as a child of the eighties who heard the soundtrack on the radios and when friends played it on -- GASP -- cassette tapes at each other's houses and at school, so of them were good songs. At least songs you can listen to without puking.

Patrick Swayze looks so young in this and he's really good in his part, and so is Jennifer Gray. Not sure why she got surgery to change her nose, she looks great in this and Ferris Bueller. A very pretty girl who is good in this and could also do comedy.

Have to say though the whole age difference thing is pretty creepy, what is she in this like 16? And he's in his thirties? Ewwwwwww! Why, Patrick Swayze, why?!?!?!
