Funny character, bad story
It wasn't a bad movie but I came in with high expectations. In the end, the funny moment cannot save a movie without a story. If by throwing in some punchlines and some CGIs, the studio can expect a big pay day, I will be very disappointed of the audience preferences. We should have better superhero movies.

In addition, a superhero movie is as good as the villain in the movie, and I will have to say this one is rather pedestrian. Normally, bad people still have their reasons to do the things they do, and it needs to be sufficiently explained and exploited to tell a good story. I am not sure about the bad guys in this movie, there really isn't an epic struggle to be remembered, no matter how much CGI is in the film.
