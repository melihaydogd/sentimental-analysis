What the hell did I just watch? You aren't alone in wondering this....
I am shocked by the IMDb rating. I use the site daily, and always appreciate other user's reviews before I decide to watch something. This is actually my first IMDb review. Under the Skin was so shockingly bad that I had to contribute. The entire movie plods along the same line until around the last 5-10 minutes. TRULY-- do not expect for any plot to actually develop until you've wasted 100 minutes of your life. Yes, the music is creepy/cool, Scotland is beautiful, etc...but there is no story here. I love weird interesting movies like Enemy (2013) with Jake Gyllenhaal, or Mr. Nobody (2009) with Jared Leto. I was expecting something like that with this movie, but NOPE.
