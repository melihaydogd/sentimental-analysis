Our boring, boring, galaxy
I can't see how any adult could sit through this mixed bag of Sesame looking,and Sesame named,characters. I took my kids to see this boring, boring, movie in it's debut. 10 min into the movie I realized, this movie is meant for the 10 to 15 year old mentality as are most of today's movies. Special explosive effects, stupid unpronounceable character names is the ticket for the Oscar, no need for a story. Although,this movie had a story that no kid or adult could understand . Then when you start remaking the movie dozens of times over like Jaws 15, Rocky 85, the Harry Potter series,and even the God Father 3 it destroys the original movie they start to look like all our cable re run movies. All those Star Wars chronicles are just a reminder of today's adolescent movie mentality. I fell asleep during the first movie and my kids 8 and 12 could not tell me what is was about. I tried again to watch it a few years later but couldn't make to the end it was like I was being put through a KGB torture interrogation. Sorry Star War fans but I'm on to TCM to watch an adult flick I'll leave the Stars War series to the kiddies and the Star Trek fans.
