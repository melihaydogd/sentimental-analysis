Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) Review - 7.8/10
Return of the Jedi is definitely the weakest movie of the original trilogy. That's not saying it was bad movie, it's not by any means, it's just bad compared to the first two films, which...how could it not be, those films are near-perfect. It was a fitting and satisfying end though, which resolved Darth Vader's story in a very nice and warm way.
