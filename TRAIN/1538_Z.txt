Fun Cult Classic
With about thirty minutes left in this movie, I had my rating set at two-and-a-half stars, a rating I usually give to the movies that aren't particularly bad, but are also pretty forgettable. And then the final scene happened, and I thought to myself "You know what? This movie is a lot of fun after all!" and then proceeded to raise my rating to give Dirty Dancing a passing grade.

And that last song has been stuck in my head ever since.
