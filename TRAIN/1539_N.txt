"Is there anybody in there?"
Art-rock group Pink Floyd's mammoth best-selling album "The Wall" is visualized by talented filmmaker Alan Parker, with live-action and animation fleshing out a rather loosely-hinged story of rock 'n roll madness. Bob Geldof looks perpetually wounded and benumbed as the rock star who rose from a harrowing childhood in working class England to his present drug-induced state, complete with hangers-on, sex and self-mutilation. He finds this all an empty, soul-destroying experience--and, after 90 minutes of slithering, often excruciating imagery, so did I. Pink Floyd's music is certainly moving and disturbing, and many of Parker's visuals do compliment the songs (he has an uncanny grasp of personal demons and how to bring them to life), but the attempt at formulating actual characters from the concept is a failure. *1/2 from ****
