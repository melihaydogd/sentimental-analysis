Moby Dick meets dragons in a right medieval muddle
I was actually sort of intrigued if somewhat dubious, but no matter how bad I thought it could've gone, I honestly was not expecting it to be this bad, almost Dungeons & Dragons bad. I am not going to detail how far it deviates from Moby Dick, you can tell from the plot summary it is going to, and I am going to judge Age of the Dragons on its own merits. Age of the Dragons sadly doesn't have many good merits, if any at all. The landscapes and scenery are reasonably good in scale but dully lit, lacking a true sense of wonder. The editing is choppy, while the dragon effects are not bad as such but nothing to be thrilled about either as the dragons themselves actually aren't used very well at all. The music lacks sparkle and feels sluggish, but it was the story, characters and especially the script that sank Age of the Dragons further. The characters are more irritating than engaging and have resorted to fantasy clichés rather than the complex characters of the original story. The story is slow and predictable, with the action scenes the anti-thesis of thrilling and the fantasy elements lacking imagination. The script is terrible, one of the worst scripts of any film recently, consisting of corny, stilted dialogue and just very humourless and stiff in tone. The acting fares little better, the main female is a small bright spot because she is hot and her acting doesn't rely too much on it. Vinnie Jones however is very bland, while Danny Glover, other than the premise the main selling-point of me seeing Age of the Dragons in the first place, chews the scenery to pieces and in the end it was painful to watch him. Overall, a right medieval muddle, humourless, unimaginative, predictable, clichéd and dull, everything a fantasy/adventure movie should not be. 1/10 Bethany Cox
