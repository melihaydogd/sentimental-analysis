'Funny, Entertaining, Crude- Everything you want it to be' Puts the SPRING in Springfield!!!
Finally I have had the pleasure after many long years of waiting to screen test this movie- and afterwards I can scarcely say this is definitely going to be the highest grossing animated movie ever made!! It has all the usual characters (its obvious when watching that the creators wanted to show every character from the TV series even if it means giving them a small part) of course there's Homer, who is as loud and proud as always, and Marge, who is cautious but loving throughout Homers huge mishap (which would stretch out to be the storyline) and Bart, Lisa and Maggie are all back too.

The storyline is quite different for a Simpsons theme- Homer miraculously pollutes the local river, thus the power plant is closed down and the residents of Springfield are evacuated. Cue the Simpsons who must fight to save their town or lose it forever!!! I was interested to discover that Mo was given a lot of the limelight in this movie, and that Homer was less seen than some of the other characters- hmm... Anyways, there really is little to criticise about this movie. A lot of people are rattling on about the movie being too similar to a single stretched-out episode, but this was always going to be an issue from the beginning. I suppose if you go into the movie expecting an overly long episode then thats what you'll get, but if you take it with a pinch of salt then the Simpsons Movie is great fun, and very funny.
