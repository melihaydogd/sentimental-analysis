How did this project EVER get greenlit?
Now, I can happily say that I did NOT rent this movie. This horrible film was on a Sci-Fi channel late one night, and I laughed so hard for so long watching it!

The acting is bad. The special effects are real bad. The hair is the worst. The girls' hair changes colour every scene ("due to the Earth's sun"), it's bigger than Dolly Parton's hair on a bad hair day after she's been in the wind for 36 hours; and their father/spaceguy leader who's looking for them could very well be the newest "before" picture in a Grecian 5 commercial.

This movie is sick - there's no other way to put it. Rent it simply for a good laugh.
