Live, Die, Repeat!!!
A refreshingly innovative concept backed up with well thought out, creative and eye-catching cinematic execution along with due attention towards simplistic explanation of all the varied sequences which could have easily been quite complex for the majority audience. The movie was laced with perfect doses of wit and humour as well. Moreover, all the actors, led by Tom and Emily, did a fantastic job to say the least. The last scene as the cue for the song "Love me again" (one if my all-time favs) was the perfect icing on the cake! This film is surely one for the ages. Live, Die, Repeat!!!
