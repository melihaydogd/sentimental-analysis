Season 5, back on the horse
Dear The Expanse, Thomas Jane has the mojo, listen to this guy and ask him questions if you don't know what to do with the show. It does not matter what role he is in, doesn't matter, make him the Grip - what's a grip? Don't care, as long as he is there things are firing on all cylinders.What is that quixotic look on your face...You wanted more aliens, and Star Gate episodes?No no no. This season brings back some things that worked "oh so right" in season 1.Miller... I miss Miller. I keep thinking this thought. Where did he go?The proto-molecule got him and turned him into a Director! Miller is in episode 3 (Thomas Jane - directing)Sometimes you have to wait a bit for a "wow" moment. So far, Season Five has them coming from all angles, and quite a bit from the mastery and skill of everybody. If the cinematographers want expensive new lighting for something, give it to them! The "eye" for the scenes is amazing, just amazing.Did you see that yet? Drummer, private moments, the lighting... close-ups on her face... Somebody (cinematographers) brought their A-Game. (again)
