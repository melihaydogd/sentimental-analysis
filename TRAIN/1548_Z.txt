Over-hyped and tedious
Hats off to Ryan Gosling to learn to play the piano for this - great achievement However, in the end people cannot suddenly become talented pianists, singers and dancers just by practising for a film part. each of these skill is extraordinarily tough and unfortunately I don't think the lead characters pulled off either the singing or dancing elements very well. the result was insipid and not very memorable.

Within five minutes of leaving the cinema there were no tunes or dance sequences that I could recall and the plot itself was rather depressing. All in all not worth the money
