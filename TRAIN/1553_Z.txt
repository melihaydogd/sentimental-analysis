This movie doesn't 'do' totalitarian very well...
After watching this movie, I had to agree with an earlier posting which stated that this movie didn't really present a believable totalitarian regime. When the troops stormed in after the Benny Hill skit, I half expected the bloke to blurt: "How dare you barge in here during tea!??!" You need to present a really dour, Machiavellian political atmosphere, where all sense of personal freedom is removed. Where the threat of brutalities is as horrifying as the brutalities themselves. Characters with muted personalities, indicating fearful oppression, but yet moments of humanity peeking through (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid's Tale, THX 1138) and the hero should begin like all the others, no different than they are, except for a courageous ability to rebel. For as long as there is even only one defiant character, the world is saved. There hasn't been a movie like that in a long time. Just look at what they did to the remake of 'Rollerball' - I'm afraid to see what they'll do to 'Logan's Run'.
