Don't get too excited...
This is certainly a technically excellent and visually rich film. However, that&#39;s not a good enough reason to rate this film so high. 10/10? 9/10? It&#39;s a good film, I agree, but it&#39;s certainly not one the all-time greats.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a film about a rat who is a top chef because he learnt how to cook by reading a book. It&#39;s therefore a film for children. Unfortunately, my children, and many others sitting around us in a packed cinema last weekend, were restless by the mid-point. Despite it&#39;s great visuals, Ratatouille is just a bit boring. It lacks the excitement and humour of The Incredibles, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, and Toy Story (1 &amp; 2). Given this children&#39;s film struggles to maintain the attention of children (a recurring theme in many reviews on this site), it&#39;s got to be rated down.<br/><br/>As an adult, meanwhile, I was left cold by the unsubtle moralising, the ludicrous mix of accents, and the fact the restaurant, outside the kitchen, looked nothing at all like a top Paris restaurant.<br/><br/>Sorry. Disappointed.
