Features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time
Not only does Ratatouille do a fantastic job of portraying the joy of eating, but it also features one of my favorite animated movie moments of all time (the childhood flashback scene). Yes, the premise is goofy and, yes, rodents are actually pretty disgusting, but that doesn&#39;t make me love this movie any less. This is one of the Pixar greats.
