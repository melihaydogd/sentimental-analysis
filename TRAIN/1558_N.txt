Not Good
Sounded good on paper just wasn't delivered at all well. PIKE plays her usual posh British woman (most of them not like that really) Clive Owen meant to be American sounded British throughout. Basically a man gets sent down for GBH PROTECTING his wife and daughter, is then released to go undercover to get a polish gangster, it goes wrong ends up back in prison for five years to go undercover again, gets betrayed by FBI (Owen) escapes and gets saved at end by his handler (Pike) walks off, listing roll simple as that!! and my God set us up for a second...... Please NO
