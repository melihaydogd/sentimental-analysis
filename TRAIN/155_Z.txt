Okay, Boring, Slow, Sometimes Good
-Okay, Boring, Slow, Sometimes Good. -Special effects good, some good action scenes. -Starts off VERY slow, boring. -No character development. Johnny Depp's character seems to "overdo it." -The movie is more about events, and it forgets to infuse human element and character into it. -Okay/a little better than average for a summer movie. -The sets, costumes, and special effects were better than the movie itself.
