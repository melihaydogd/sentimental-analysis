 Lousy and seemingly endless!
Biggest disappointment of the year! It started alright, nice scenery shots and a bunch of happy little creatures. But the moment you get used to the surroundings and creatures, you start to notice that it is one simple and utterly predictable story in which the good prevails over everything! The apotheosis is that after three hours of boredom there is now ending!                    4 out of 10 found this helpful.
