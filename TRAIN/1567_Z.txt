Reasonable but leaving me behind with a hangover
The story is okay but the acting of Tye Sheridan could be much better. The clerc's (Tye Sheridan) acting is not convincing at all. The story is constructive but is destroyed by the unconvincing acting of "Bart Bromley". Helen Hunt has only a small part to play but is okay. I was afraid that the end would be as how a lot of stories nowadays ends and it did ...leaving the viewer disillusioned, as he/she walks straigth into a black hole. For me it was an ending which made me think "what a waste of time".
