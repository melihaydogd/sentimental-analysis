It will rape your soul
This movie seems to have just one purpose, to show the limitless depravity of the human race.  It's artful. Well acted. It is unforgettable. It will take a piece of your soul from you, and you'll never get it back. I am not a better or wiser person for having seen this movie. And I was not entertained. The movie takes from the viewer and gives nothing in return. You'll be a better person for not seeing it.
