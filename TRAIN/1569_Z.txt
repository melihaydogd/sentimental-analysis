Lost the surrealism
It's 1993. Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is an angry ad exec who misses his daughter's 3rd birthday for a business diner. He is a womanizing drunk. He gets kidnapped and finds himself imprisoned in a motel-like room. He gets gassed periodically. He watches news report that he is assumed to have raped and killed his ex-wife. He vowed to clean up his act and makes an escape attempt 20 years later. He gets gassed again and finds himself in a suitcase trunk in an open field. He is led to nurse Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) working at a mobile clinic. He reconnects to an old friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli) who was the last guy to see him. Chucky helps him investigate who it was that imprisoned him. Joe passes out and Chucky calls in nurse Marie. Chaney (Samuel L. Jackson) is the prison warden. The mysterious stranger (Sharlto Copley) is threatening his daughter. Then the stranger offers him vindicating evidence, his daughter's safety, $20 million in diamonds and the promise to kill himself if Joe can find out who he is and why he did it.It is hard to rate this because I saw the original first. That takes the surprise twist ending out of it for me. Director Spike Lee is doing a very straight logical interpretation of the surreal Korean original. It's dark and stark. It doesn't really have the magic and the weird left turns that the original keeps taking. The constant straightening out leaves this movie cold and unimaginative. It becomes nothing more than a revenge movie with a twist. Worst of all, Spike Lee left out the live octopus eating. I do like the final poetic ending. That is a nice little surreal touch.
