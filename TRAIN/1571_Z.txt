Very Poor and Unnecessary Sequel
Personally, I don't understand how Kung Fu Panda 3 has a higher IMDb rating than the first or second films. Maybe as more people rate it, that number will drop but don't take it as representing the quality of the film.

I could rant endlessly about what was wrong with this film but instead I'll just say this: If you've seen the first two films, then just assume that you've seen this one as well. Apart from the addition of Bryan Cranston, this film hasn't changed much.

Even the humour in this one appears to be sadly lacking in relation to the previous two. This sequel makes the same error that all sequels are making these days. They follow a formula to make this film exactly the same as the previous ones, just with a slightly altered storyline e.g. a new villain who has never been mentioned previously.
