More down than up
I found the story having a bit of a weird twist. I liked very much this animation from the very beginning till the moment the guys takes off in his house. All that was very touching and so realistic and full of life. But just as the guys takes off, everything from that moment completely loses the sense of reality, turns into a complete fairy tale without any foundation, and to my experience just bananas, spoils everything nice I first felt about the story, and the storyline never comes back to earth from that moment, it's all cheap Pixar bag of old tricks, nothing else, no substance. I was so pi$$ed in the end that the hyped me up with the first 1/3 of the movie just to let me down with the rest.In other words, they made the first 1/3 of the story interesting for any age, and the rest is only for under 16 at best.
