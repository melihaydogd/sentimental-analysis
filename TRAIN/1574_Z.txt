GAS Pump Girls
I was 14 and lived down the street from where this was filmed. I used to walk by the filming everyday on my way home from school. The actors (yes ,Kirsten) were very cool and took the time to talk to the local kids. In fact, Kirsten told me that the name under consideration was Super Duper Garage at the time. The Pyramid station across the street was actually built just for the film. They built it and tore it down right after the filming. The city is actually not Sacramento as is thanked in the credits, but Del Paso Heights. The station is located on the corner of Arcade Blvd and Marysville Blvd. The scene where they ride the motorcycles down the street was filmed farther down the same street the station is on near where it crosses El Camino Blvd. Overall it is a pretty crappy film (4), but for those that live by the shooting location it is now the only and probably will always be the only movie ever shot in the city. Nostalgic to say the least (9). Good times.
