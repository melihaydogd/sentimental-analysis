GOOD BUT NOT GREAT
"The darkest chapter form conjuring universe but not the best and not even better than conjuring

the beginning of the film feels promising, but the more behind the plot the more strange and there are some things that seem ""forced""

this film feels so dark and too many jump scare

I think, the rating of this film is better than annabelle but no better than conjuring"
