Awful
I feel that this movie was just awful. The acting was horrendous and the story was bland. The action was minimal compared to the amount of stupid drama. Rorscach was the only bright spot in this film, his character was the only one that kept me interested. It just continually proved to me that Marvel will always outfilm DC, its a fact. The awkward sex scenes are unnecessary and even the music in the film was corny. I would say that this movie lacked something but that would be an understatement, this movie lacked mostly everything. It was painful to watch and the fact that it was almost a 3 hour movie mad it 10 times worse.
