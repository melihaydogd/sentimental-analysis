Never though it could be worse than Oblivion....
Not sure what is the problem with science fiction these days, but truly, most fail.

That is not right, Matt Damon's one was pretty strong and decent, but the rest....

On par with Oblivion, Edge Of Tomorrow is a bit about clone, the only different is that it is not humans that are clone, but time.

This repeating time thing certainly doesn't appeal to me (the same scenes being projected multiple times is truly boring). But there is worst.

The plot of this movie is non-existent, the first thing we know is that a man not fit for combat is sent to the frontline for an obscure reason. Since it is in the future, fighters are wearing can of robotic skeletons, The robotic things looks very stupid by the way. It felts like more of a weight burden than an advantage, which is lame.

Tom Cruise trying to look like a virgin gun welder is not bad, but it is a bit guffaw.

Oh I didn't watch all the movie, but I guess 20 minutes give me a good idea of what will be the rest (since everything repeats almost identically for the reminder of the movie).

Almost forgot, we have no idea what is the foe doing or purpose.
