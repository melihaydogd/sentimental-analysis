Very high influx of the Africans in France!
I will not share enthusiasm for this film. I saw other reviews. I know it is politically correct to help people. And I did not think of the disabled people. I was thinking about millions of Africans and other immigrants trying to come into France, specially Paris and trying to find a job. How many will succeed, one per cent? This film focuses on a aristocrat who hires a poor African from the suburbs of Paris. How often that happens in the real life? Not that often.

Plot is, well OK, but not that realistic, and that is what I hate. I like realistic plots not improbable ones like this one.

Acting is excellent, actors are really trying to make something out of this film. Many people liked it. I did not that much.
