Not Worth It
Sure, there's some good stuff, but it's just not worth it. One of it's very numerous flaws is that there's a ton of "drama" about how "oppressed" homosexuals are, which brings the entire story to a crawl and messes up the pace. Sure, Hugo Weaving is funny, but that doesn't excuse the story being so bad. If you want decent drama, you're not gonna find it here. If you want action, too bad; "V for Vendetta" has hardly any, and what's there is mindless and mediocre. Not even cool, and nothing like the Matrix. I don't know what the Wachowski Brothers were thinking when they wrote this mess of a movie that no particular target audience can enjoy.
