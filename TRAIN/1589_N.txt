One Very polluted Ocean
Wow this ocean stank and emitted flatulence. It is like taking an actual ocean, cloning it but infusing it with all sorts of female hormones and tar and sand and then asking people to pay to swim in it.
I was going to say the actresses had zero chemistry but actually this was full of foul chemicals.
