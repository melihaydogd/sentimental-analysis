Epic fail
We watched this at home as a rental. The pacing was okay and there were enough plot points to keep the viewer watching and make it interesting. It was largely predictable, but not in a particularly annoying way. My husband and I discussed several possible twists during the film, finally deciding on the scenario that turned out to be correct. Even so, it was a decent film until the very end when my rating went from a 5 to a 2.

I was willing to accept the private detective who gave unrealistically timely and incredibly incorrect updates. What I won't accept is that the police don't follow even the most basic of crime scene procedures after the shooting. The most inept coroner would notice that "Tony" had not fired any gun and a cursory swab analysis of "Sarah's" hands would show that she had two different powders on them. I am not comparing this to the unrealistic standards of an episode of CSI, Bones, or Criminal Minds where the world's supposedly best forensic minds have access to the world's best (and sometimes futuristic) crime scene forensic technologies. Even overworked NY City cops would have done swabs in what might seem an open and shut case. Maybe especially in this case as cops tend to be suspicious by nature...
