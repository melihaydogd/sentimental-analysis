Waste of 2 hours... DEMAND a Refund of my $5 Groupon
OK, so not what we were expecting at all... let's just say it started out super slow... too much love mixed in what is supposed to be Sci-Fi action. Would not recommend seeing for full price. I am upset that I wasted my SMG Groupons on this movie. Would have been upset at the $1 theater too because it was a boring waste of time. If you are looking for action, wrong film to see. If you are looking for adventure... wrong movie to see. If you are looking for a hero.. wrong movie to see. If you are looking for a good movie.. wrong movie to see. Let's just say, not sure why this movie has 7.2 rating... must be the big names of Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman. Should have gone to see Olympus Has Fallen instead... boy oh boy... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! Final words: #HotMess.Com
