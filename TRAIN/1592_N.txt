I think its only good to a fan.
So I got dragged along to see this with my friends at the midnight session viewing expecting an ordinary super hero movie, which it turned out to be nothing much. I'm not a fan of the novel nor did I even know what it was about till i got there.

The movie seemed over stretched, had no real plot understanding till the last 30mins, jumped around from scene to scene too much, fights scenes were sub par, and so many useless scenes they could have cut, some pretty bad acting from Malin Akerman for a movie like this. I thought the music that went with the movie was also pretty awful and could have had a better music selection. The movie seemed to be over explained and left nothing the you imagination, it seemed like there was constant narrating through out the whole movie.

Overall, not a movie for the ordinary person, if your not a fan of the novel then you probably won't like the movie. From my understanding they tried to stay true to the novel, for me it was just overdone.
