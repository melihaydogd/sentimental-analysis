Film should have a maximum age limit of 10
The film is made out of Ryan Reynolds, throwing lame jokes to the camera. In between there are bullets and knifes. No surprises. No ideas. The story is simple and silly and boring. Man sleeps with woman long in different scenes (Teens hello! Better watch porn, there are more details!) Man go's to basement to become special. (Teens like to be special) Man becomes special and kills all bad guys around him. THE END

The jokes are not only lame, they are old. For example the joke with the red shirt and brown trousers I heard from my grandpa.

Don't waste your time with this film. Marvell tries to squeeze out last cents out of the theme. Bad films will follow.
