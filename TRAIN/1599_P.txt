unusual masterpiece
Wow! this one is a diamond in the rough!Knowing nothing about the story I was quickly drawn in for an odd but amazing ride. The story is thought provoking rather than amusing, one is left to draw own conclusions. Beautifully shot with breathtaking nature and landscapes. Scarlett is perfectly cast in this role, she is beautiful as always and it's great to see so much more of her :) The man in the story are convincing in their roles.The film is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, there is no doubt there. Perfect oddity for this rainy day! I enjoyed every minute of this film giving it a 9 out of 10.
