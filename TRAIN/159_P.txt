Brilliant movie. Awesome Sci-Fi. Worth wacthing it.
"Edge of Tomorrow" is an unique installment on the list of the Top Sci-Fi movies of all time. As every movie it consists of 4 stages. The First Act (Introduction, Preparation for the story), the Second Act (Action Scenes), the Third Act (Final Climax) and the Final Act (Resolution, Ending). The director, Doug Liman did a brilliant work with the First and Second act of this film. However, the Third Act is a bit different and not as climatic as I would wanted it to be. Moreover, I expected it to be a boring movie, beacause of the fact and we would be watching the same day over and over again. Thankfully, I was wrong. Every loop and repetition of this day was different than the others in an unique way. This made the movie very interesting to see how Doug Liman managed to acomplish this director-challenge. All in all it is an awesome movie with a brilliant plot and good actors. I hope there is a sequel, which keeps all of the advantages and turns the disadvantages into more advantages and I am sure, that Doug Liman will do so. To sum up it is a worth watching movie with clever characteristics in it. Every frame feels like a loop worth sitting in. Must see movie. However, be as always cautious, not to have very high expectations, in order not to ruin a good-movie.
