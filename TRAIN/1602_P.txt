It's for kids, why the bad reviews?
It's about Guinea pig secret agents. It's a great family film. It's got guinea pigs causing havoc and spouting bond-esque one liners (watch for the references to other films). I'm not sure why it has such bad press. It's full of Guinea pig action and jokes aimed at younger kids. What is not to appreciate? Do we have to expect real guinea pigs?!
