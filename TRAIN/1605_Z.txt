Overrated "Musical"
What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said. This was advertised as a musical, but just comes off as dry. There are only a few good musical parts like the dance scene between Gosling and Stone. It starts out strong with the freeway song and dance but only goes down from there.

The plot.. well there really doesn't seem to be much of a plot. It's a love story, but ultimately ends up not being about the love story. It really is all over the place. Plus how many times do I have to hear one song throughout the film. It's like watching Grease but they play Grease lightening five times. City of stars... yeah we got it. I hate trash this movie because I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, but what a disappointment of a film.
