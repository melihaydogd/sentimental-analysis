Great Fun, Disappointing Stake
Not a masterpiece comparable with the recent Disney and Pixar animations, but still a worthy animated show, skillfully directed and full of good taste humor.

It's very interesting to notice the script's way of mixing together qualities and flaws. Yeatman's original story is pretty cheap, naive and unconvincing (mainly in the final parts, that I won't spoil for you - still, one should say that the conclusion is worse than disappointing), but fortunately the Wibberleys are able to recuperate it in a great proportion, by articulating the plot into a solid and well built script. As such, Yeatman's main contribution remains the directing - efficient, precise, professional.

Of course, the great fun are the characters - but, attention: NOT the human ones, which remain simplistic and full of clichés (in a deliberate but sparkless way, attempting to keep the movie at the facile level one supposes it's appropriate for children), but the rodents: credible, amusing and endearing portraits, responsible for the permanent joyous smile (also marked by a few laughs) that follows from start to end this enjoyable new 3D experience.
