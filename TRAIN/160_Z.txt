The movie is taking the A-Team too serious
Unless you are a big A-Team fan, another movie called The Losers, has a better chance to entertain you. I saw both on the same day. Both were short on meaningful dialogs or plot development but at least The Losers were actually funny while the A-Team was just plain boring and loud. Every character was over exaggerated to an extend were it was annoying.

Both movies feature an action movie camera style where fast cuts and shaky cameras prevent you from being able to follow whats really going on and who is beating or shooting who. Again in the A-Team was a lot worse than in The Losers.

If you are an A-Team fan you could like it, if you just want a fun action movie and a good time get "The Losers"
