Silly and generic
It's no different from any superhero movie out there - bombastic, silly/stupid, and generic. The plot is essentially what you see in almost EVERY superhero origin movie out there: guy gets a superpower, then he gets emo about this new superpower, then gets girl problems that ultimately becomes the driving force of the climax. Ryan Reynolds essentially plays himself here. If you like Shrek movies, fart jokes, and cartoon-like plotting and characterization, then this is your movie. If you are a fan of film, and want to push these kinds of garbage to the nether where they belong, please avoid this film. There's really nothing redeeming about this film except some humor.
