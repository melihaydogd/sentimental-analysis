"Nobody" is a cheap nothing...
A low-rent "John Wick" rip-off with absolutely none of the cinematic panache or thrills of Keanu Reeves' franchise. Odenkirk fails to deliver a character that we can believe is capable of such single-handed destruction. The supporting cast is riddled with clich√©s. "Nobody" is a cheap nothing... lacking cool... lacking joy... lacking thought.
