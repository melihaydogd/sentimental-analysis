A-Hole Team
I won't even give this incoherent mess a proper review because it does not deserve one. It is not a film, it is a video game in the sense that reality, physics and timing mean nothing. You have no sense that anyone is ever in danger, everyone is a comedian, the US Army is bunch of people who have no idea what anyone else is doing and rank is a non factor. This is a movie made for a 13 year old who has the attention span of a gnat. Two hours of non stop BS wrapped in a ludicrous plot. I hated the A-Team TV show because it was so silly and I was a teen at the time, this garbage makes that look like Shakespeare. This is the most overwhelmingly bad movie in a decade. The film makers should be embarrassed.
