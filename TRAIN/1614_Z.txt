Initially an entertaining movie turning to a waste of Time!
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz appeared in this action-comedy movie which failed in both the action and comedy ventures. Tom Cruise as Roy Miller in this movie had no problems working as the role of a secret agent whilst Cameron Diaz is the conventional Blonde who becomes a reluctant colleague in his daring scenes. When I first saw the trailer of Knight and Day, I predicted it a fairly mainstream summer flick. I thought that having Tom Cruise back for doing his best in this action-hero character would guarantee his viewing. When I finished seeing it, I felt about as though I should be reviewing on two separate films.

Hauling a bagful of metal scrap to repair her father's old car, Cameron Diaz as June Havens is on her way to her sister's wedding when she accidentally met handsome and charming Roy Miller (Tom Cruise). After continually meeting each other at the airport and finally on the same flight, they began to flirt with each other.

The first half part of this movie assures a firm, fun experience due mainly to the jokes between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. These two have great movie chemistry and some scenes between them are extremely hilarious. It's the perfect combination of comedy and action, and everything seemed to be going efficiently. It seemed like whenever the action scene was to get good they had to remind you how childish and silly this movie was to be. The amazing use of leather jacket by Tom Cruise in this movie made the jacket lovers attracted to him. The exact replica of his leather jacket is available at one of the leading websites known as desert leather. They manufacture the same leather jackets as worn by the Hollywood celebrities.

Overall, "Knight and Day" is an OK movie due to its brand new script, great presentations, magnificent shooting incredible action, good comic timing, and an enthralling direction. And for the first time, it's actually not gratuitous!
