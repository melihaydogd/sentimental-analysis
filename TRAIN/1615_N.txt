Struggled to get into the movie! 3/10
Review: I really tried hard to get into this strange movie, but I struggled to keep up with the slow tempo and the fact that there is hardly any talking throughout. I found the music annoying and I didn't get what she was doing with the men that she picked up from the street. Coming from the director of Sexy Beast, this is a completely different type of movie which I didn't really enjoy. I get the whole alien thing, but watching it for nearly 2 hours was a bit much. There's just too many scenes were there is totally nothing happening. It took me a couple of watches to try and work out what angle the director was coming from, but I still failed to find the point. Disappointing!Round-Up: At this stage of Scarlett Johannsens career, I thought that she was brave to take on a role like this because it's geared fully by emotion and actions which is totally different to the many blockbusters that she has starred in. Personally, I didn't like the film, but if give her credit for her performance. The scene near the end in the forest was a bit strange and judging by the money that the movie made, I'm not the only one that thought that this was a weird movie to watch.Budget: $13.3million Worldwide Gross: $5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there mysterious alien movies about a woman who travel the earth and uses her seductive abilities to get her victims. 3/10
