Has Great Moments, but is too slow and predictable
This movie has a great plot and it is filled with many layers. However, I feel like it took too long to get to the ending it was leading up to. It got repetitive and long. With everything going on so slowly, it gave the movie a fantastic sense of dread that made us relate to the parents. However, it also gave me time to think and I was able to figure out the ending twist halfway through the movie. Another thing that bothered me was the red herring that appeared halfway through. It was obvious and should have been cut down for time.  Although I have my gripes, I overall enjoyed this movie. The acting was superb. Everyone did a fantastic job, but Paul Dano and Hugh Jackman stole the whole thing. They gave Oscar-worthy performances. I also give credit to DP Roger Deakins for the amazing visuals. The highlight of his work was during the rush to the hospital near the end. Simply phenomenal. I wasn't just at the edge of my seat; I was out of it, my eyes glued to the screen and fists clenched. It was so suspenseful and it was solely because of the cinematography. I also loved the plot of the movie, but I just feel like it dragged out. It would have been an excellent 2 hour movie instead of 2 and 1/2 hours.  I enjoyed this movie and I'd recommend this movie. However, I would not want to see it again.
