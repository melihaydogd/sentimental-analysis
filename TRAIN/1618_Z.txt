Why bother with history?

AS a swords and sorrow epic this is okay, good performances, pretty locations, but why bother to pretend that it's about Henry IV and V? Not to mention Falstaff? A straight fiction could have worked; but this half-assed gesture in the direction of historical accuracy is just irritating. And it sure drags.
