Worst Hamlet Ever - thanks to Tennant
ACTING! Tennant is so bad that the otherwise so-so production is rendered ludicrous. The CCTV touches are foolish, but only mildly annoying compared to Tennant's banal, manic interpretation of his role. He renders Hamlet a clown, a caricature, a ridiculous figure to be cringed at. No nobility, no dignity, just a mad fool. Hyper-active, ADHD-driven, he needs some Ritalin to calm him down. There's not a single scene he's in that he does not ruin with his childish antics and wild grimaces and twisted gestures. Otherwise this production is just acceptable. The supporting cast is so overshadowed by Tennant's hysteria that they seem stunned, dismayed and disbelieving. There are scenes – Hamlet absent – that work well enough, but their effect is soon lost. Embarrassingly bad.
