Boring and no dept
Good for you, for first reading the review. Coz I went in blank.

First of all it was really weird not to see the emotion of surprise, I kept thinking that emotion would be hidden (or maybe there were already thinking about a sequel).

The movie has some funny moments, but it just doesn't live up to Pixar standards they we are used to (don't expect Monster Inc).

The story is very predictible and becomes are drag quite quick. Even the "sad' moment feels staged an you see it coming. Would recommend this movie to anyone. There are so many better titles.
