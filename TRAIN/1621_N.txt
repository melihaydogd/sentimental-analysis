 Repetitive and overrated
I watched this film the day before seeing Amelie, and the difference in films was astounding.  After the beginning, where the main character gets his ring, the rest of the film revolves around him surviving various attacks from various different creatures.I have no inclination to watch the second as I'm sure it'll be more creatures providing more attacks, with little real 'plot'As seems to be standard in big budget action films nowadays, there's the token "funny" character (the Welsh bloke) who is simply there to provide cheap laughs.I can't fathom how this is number 4 in the IMDB top 250.
