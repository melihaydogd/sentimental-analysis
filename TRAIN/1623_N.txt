Pitiful piece of film making
Wow I wish I had seen the same film that the people who gave this an average of 8.3/10 and put it in the top 250 films. I tried to keep an open mind as I sat through the worse action scenes I'd ever seen. I tried to find some redeeming qualities for the poor actors, I like Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, who had to spit out the worse duologue I've heard in years. The Brothers Wachowski must have still been taking their psychedelic drugs, you know the ones they were on when they made the second and third Matrix films. This movie suffers from the same types of issues as Aeon Flux, no story or a poorly told story. Even a bad story can be made good by a storyteller who knows how to pull out all of the best elements. Too bad 1/10
