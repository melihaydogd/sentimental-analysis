A First Rate Film
I just saw &quot;Ratatouille&quot; tonight.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a first class movie. Several thoughts come to mind...<br/><br/>-The character performances are so good, I think there&#39;s no sort of movie they couldn&#39;t make. I&#39;ve heard Pixar&#39;s John Carter of Mars is going to be live action? No! I want them to do it all animated.<br/><br/>-&quot;Cars&quot; definitely _was_ a lower-value softball they threw to finish out that original Disney-gets-half-of-everything-plus-sequel-rights contract they were in at the time. I remember all the clucking last summer about how Pixar had lost its way.<br/><br/>-There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely &quot;real&quot;.<br/><br/>-There was one scene in the latter part of the film where I thought &quot;I can&#39;t believe they are doing this tired movie clich√©&quot; but they pulled out of it at the last second and made it something new.<br/><br/>-The 2D-ish end credits were great. Stick it out to the very end to see the mo-cap disclaimer!<br/><br/>-With this, Brad Bird is certainly one of the animation gods now.
