Perfect graphic, basically no story
The movie did an amazing work on the graphics. Texture, light, everything looks very real. Since many war scene are involved, there're plenty explosions to demonstrate the cutting edge CGI work.

However, if you didn't read anything about the story in advance, the movie will make no sense to you.

You can feel it when an important character shows up. Yet since there's no introduction on the back ground story, the things characters do make no sense to you. If you played any FF game in the past, some of the things is very obvious, like the ring. But the overall story telling is very poor. Huge monsters show up with no explain, huge statue come alive and no one in the movie surprised.

I guess I wasn't the only asking myself what's going on again and again. 

I hope the story completes itself in the game.
