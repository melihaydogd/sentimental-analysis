'The Skeleton Key' Did It First ...
... and did it better. The 2005 horror/thriller starring Kate Hudson, Gena Rowlands, John Hurt and Peter Sarsgaard brings atmospheric dread to the body-switching genre, complete with voodoo, an antebellum mansion and the swamps of Louisiana. Yes, there are black characters and white characters and elements of racism in the old south (black servants are hanged and burned in front of rowdy 1920s party guests in one scene). But unlike "Get Out," "The Skeleton Key" doesn't overthink it or try to be socially or politically provocative. Here the black-white roles are reversed, but not in the way you might think. It tells a story, a downright scary one. The characters bring on the chills with aplomb, and the ending is a stunner.
