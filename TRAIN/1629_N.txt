Weak
So another superhero movie. I was hoping it might be at least as good as the first if not better but alas this was really weak (just like Thor II). Some one needs to let movie directors know that action sequences (lots of sequences) do not make up for a really weak plot and exceptionally bad dialog. I agree with a lot of others that they should have developed Cap's story more. His time with his old girl was short and amounted to nothing but I guess they didn't know how not to make it too sad. You know that you're in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than your hero and all of your villains. Samuel L again rocks Nick Fury and we all know that Black Widow desires a movie of her own. I could have cared less about the Winter Soldier and poor Robert Redford was really out of place. Everyone should be glad that Shield folded because they really need to start over with some better guys. I hope the next one is a while cause I'm not looking forward to anymore action sequences.
