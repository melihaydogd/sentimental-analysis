American propaganda movie
If this movie was about Germany in the 1930s/1940s, Adolf would have been proud. It tells about the greatness of a country, the home of the good and the brave. In these times this movie is like it wants to tell us all: "Hey, we're spying on all of you, but we're doing it for the good of everyone". The most epic scenes are when the American flag is falling from the white house and at the end, when it flies again. You can learn a lot about the USA in these kind of movies: What a good person the president is, how cool the American forces are and how immense the American will is to protect everyone's freedom in the whole world. Seriously: This is propaganda at it's best. It's a shame that actors like Morgan Freeman an Gerad Butler a part of such a movie.
