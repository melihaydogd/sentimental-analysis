Hurried and lacking depth
This bland account of the Pentagon Papers story is rushed and does not do its subject matter or characters much justice. There were so many angles to approach, but it ends up a muddled piece of moralizing. The script is over-stylized and at times unintelligible. I found the directing bordering on frivolous, even irritating. The saccharine score almost made me laugh at times. However, very nice printing press scenes provided occasional welcome breaks from the rest of the action.
