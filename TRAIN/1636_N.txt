85th best movie of all time? Gimme a break...
Geez, IMDb has become incredibly unreliable. There used to be a time that a high rating for a movie meant something. Nowadays it&#39;s pretty much standard fare for anything that&#39;s popular. This movie, while I can see why many would like it, is average at best. Too many people with undiscerning taste coming in here and giving 10s to every movie they watch.<br/><br/>As fort he movie: Predictable, formulaic American/Hollywood approach to animation. Not very funny either (I think I gave a minor chuckle once). I&#39;d give it a 3 or 4, but given all the 10s given by people who probably don&#39;t even watch many movies outside the Hollywood establishment.<br/><br/>Oh a cute little rat! He acts like people! He talks! He has emotion! He loves his family! Give that baby a 10! And let&#39;s give American accents to all the main characters, so that the movie doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s really set in France.
