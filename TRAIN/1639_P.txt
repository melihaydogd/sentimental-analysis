Darth Vader Strikes Back.
Star Wars: Episode 5- The Empire Strikes Back (1980): Dir: Irwin Kershner / Cast: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse: Blindsiding visual wonder recalling the threat to Rebel forces whom are hiding on the ice planet Hoth. Luke Skywalker is instructed to seek Jedi training from Yoda. An attack by Imperial forces leaves the Rebel base in ruins but Han Solo, Princess Leia and company narrowly escape in the Millennium Falcon. They venture to Cloud City where Lando Calrissian betrays them thus setting a trap for Skywalker. Cliffhanger ending hinders it in standing on its own but director Irwin Kershner explores darker aspects. Mark Hamill returns as Luke who learns endurance, concentration, priorities, friendship, and very hard truths that leave him literally dangling for survival. Harrison Ford as Han learns to put the needs of others ahead of his own particularly when sacrifices arise. Carrie Fisher return as Leia who strengthens her leadership. Billy Dee Williams as Lando realizes his mistakes and hopes correction is possible. David Prowse dons the suit and presents the intimidating presence of Darth Vader who presents those ever famous hard hitting words to Luke. Special effects are just as electrifying with the appearance of Yoda among other creatures and landscapes. The film serves as a follow up to Star Wars with intriguing suspense and imagination. Score: 7 / 10
