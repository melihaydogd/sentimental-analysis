Massively overrated.
Quentin Tarantino is one of our time's most gifted directors/scriptwriters and obviously also one of the most childish. Kill Bill vol. 1 is not as much a movie as it is a mishmash of older, cooler martial-arts and samurai movies from the 70's. The story is simple and can be summarized in one word: revenge. in fact the whole movie can be summarized in one word: copy.

Uma Thurman plays the woman who's craving revenge, and a pretty bloody one too. The first scenes are actually crap really. Some of the worst dialog in a Tarantino movie ever is spoken and a dull fight takes place. The good thing is that the movie doesn't get worse from here, but it doesn't improve much either.

The only thing that I'll remember for some time is the gruesome anime sequence, otherwise the movie is just scene after scene that's been stolen somewhere, been made to look a bit prettier but actually also to work much worse. Uma Thurman is just not very good at handling a sword, and the surreal atmosphere is more strange than anything else. I know that Tarantino really loves samurai movies but he could have made a real movie instead of making two, inferior commercials about them!

All in all this is one of the most overrated movies ever, and I think it's more that people want to stay loyal to Tarantino than anything else.
