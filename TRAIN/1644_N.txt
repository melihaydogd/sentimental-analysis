I wish I had words to describe how bad this movie is, but I don't, you have to see it for yourself.
If you'll like this I don't know but if you expect a flick like this to have accurate, intelligent science (like 'The Martian'), I'll tell you it doesn't.

If you didn't like 'Interstellar', steer clear from this move, it's awful

Stunning CG though.

All else sucks, especially the soundtrack, which causes an excess of tension, it tries to create suspense every 5 minutes, your brain gets tired of that.
