A Let Down
I was really hoping Jim Carey would knock this one out of the park and have a really good movie. I understand he actually settled for "points" and did not get paid any money upfront for this movie - that's risky, and he should fire his manager. The movie has an interesting concept and good message, but it falls flat for so many reasons. The movie was very contrived, lacked originality, and did not know how far to go with the comedy. Things were conveniently happening just to move the story along even though they were lazily thought up and could have been better. The comedy was not screw-ball enough and failed to capitalize on Carey's strong points. I like Jim Carey, but that's just about all this movie has going for it. This movie is definitely not for the analytical type, because your suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a movie like this would not be met.
