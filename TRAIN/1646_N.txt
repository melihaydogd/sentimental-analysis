Rating is faked
This is a below average wanna-be horror movie - I just registered after 10 years of using IMDb to warn you. Yes, it builds up an interesting and somehow tense atmosphere in the first 30 minutes but then fails to deliver anything. Honestly the movie was more interesting before the "supernatural" element kicked in - if the story wasn't based in 80 Teheran there would be nothing worth watching, the settings (times and location) of this movie are more interesting than the story it tries to tell - it's neither horror nor drama. I believe the rating is manipulated (7.0 at the time I write this).
