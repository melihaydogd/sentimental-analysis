Second-hand, second-rate cut-and-paste job.
To quote the great Terry Rossio:<br/><br/>&quot;There are many films with the goal &#39;to find your way home.&#39; But there&#39;s only one film where a girl clicks together a pair of ruby slippers.&quot;<br/><br/>What that basically means is that the goal of many stories is essentially the same. The &#39;find your way home&#39; example is used in films such as E.T., The Wizard of Oz, and Back To The Future, just to name a few. Only one of those has ruby slippers. Only one has a bicycle fly past the moon. Only one has a time-traveling Delorean.<br/><br/>The goal of &#39;criminals getting together to pull off the perfect heist&#39; has been used is such films as The Killing, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and City on Fire...just to name a few. Only one had an un-chronological order to the events. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had the criminals use color-coded names to keep their identities anonymous. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had an undercover cop infiltrate a gang of crooks and befriend another crook, only to get shot during the process of the robbery, until he confesses the truth to his new friend. Until Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>If you cannot see that this entire film is just a cut and paste job, then you have to be mentally impaired. And that is not an insult.<br/><br/>As far as originality goes, Tarantino hasn&#39;t got to that point yet. The point where he creates something on his own. This is just a second hand, second rate cut and paste job that is only mildly entertaining on first viewing. Upon seeing the film subsequent times, it only gets worse, and it&#39;s (very many) flaws only stand out to an even more obvious extent. This is a bad movie even for someone who has never directed anything before in his life.<br/><br/>The film starts with a discussion that might as well be about Jesus, pancake syrup, or the duties of the school crossing guard. None of these have anything to do with the story...much like the conversation we see before the opening credits roll. Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It&#39;s not our business, it does not advance the story, and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film, just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished, NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It&#39;s complete filler. A total waste of time.<br/><br/>This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around, popping up at random, and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It&#39;s a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it&#39;s very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come, it&#39;s more of a &quot;good, it&#39;s over&quot; point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn&#39;t even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire, and in some cases...shot for shot! <br/><br/>Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast, and that&#39;s even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and f-words being used like it&#39;s going out of style (and it has, thanks to films like this), and the &quot;infamous&quot; and &quot;extreme&quot; violence is about on par with The Lion King. So if you&#39;re thinking about watching this movie...just watch a good heist movie instead. I suggest:<br/><br/>The Killing The Asphalt Jungle The Taking of Pelham One Two Three
