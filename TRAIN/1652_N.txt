Had so much potential then flop!
I agree with another reviewer Rczmiller. I'm not a prude person but this movie made me uncomfortable. I completely got it wrong thinking this would be like the "Scary Movie" hits. The story line was good, stayed true to the horror films but ruined it by turning it into one long dragged out sex reference with annoying characters (Cedric) and I usually like him.

Were all the graphically played out sex with stuff animals, being raped by ghosts, and the overdone swinger and gay references really needed? We didn't think so.

I would be laughing one minute just to get disgusted by the next ten. I can't believe we wasted our money on seeing this in the theater. A complete let down.
