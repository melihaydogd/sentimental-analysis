I did not think anything could be this bad...
I love "The Equalizer" TV series and the 2 excellent movies... this... this is not the Equalizer. It is like none of the writes - directors - people in the show saw the originals. It is very sad actually. Fight scenes that are chopped up - dialog that is lame - OVER dramatization of everyone...oh so-and-so is BEST of the BEST - and so-an-so is SO BEST of the BEST...Robert McCall never had to tell others he was BEST OF THE BEST or the people he worked with were BEST OF THE BEST... his action did it for him... when you have to be told every step of the way what you need to see or what you need to believe or what you need to know... there is something wrong.
