Boring
This film reminds me of the Henry Kissinger line where he said "When people meet me and they are bored, they think it's their fault." People who watch this movie and don't get it or are bored with it, are too embarrassed to say it, they don't want to come across as unsophisticated. So they all pretend this is some cinematic masterpiece. Oh please..... for some reason, when it's a British film, this kind of dreary Boring movie is said to be genius.. if this was made in America with American actors, people will be saying this movie sucked.
