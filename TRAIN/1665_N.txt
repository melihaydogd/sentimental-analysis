You should've watched something else
Wow, I hated this movie. It was slow and really boring. The acting was awful. The plot was one those you just lift your eyebrows at and ask "really?". There's really no point or plot to the movie, there is no character development or even introductions to them either. We get a singular backstory with no additional context and had no reason to like a single character in the movie, except for maybe the kid, but that's arguable because she wasn't really all that likeable either. I just found this movie to dumb. I have kids and couldn't imagine doing the dumb stuff Kevin Bacon does in this movie. If this movie was an emoji it would be the eyeroll one, followed by a sighing emoji.
