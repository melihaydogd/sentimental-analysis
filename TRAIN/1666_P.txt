love and duplicity
Robert Zemeckis has mostly made audience-pleasing movies (I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump, Cast Away). He occasionally opts for more mature content, such as 2012's "Flight". "Allied" is of the latter nature, although like the former group it looks to the past for inspiration.

Brad Pitt plays a Canadian intelligence officer during WWII who goes to Casablanca (where else?) to kill the German ambassador. While there he hooks up with Marion Cotillard's resistance fighter and they eventually get married. But once they move to England, he learns that there's something that he didn't know about her.

The movie makes sure to set the stage with the era's music and costumes. But the most important part remains the moral dilemma that Pitt's character faces. It's not any sort of masterpiece, but the acting makes up for the movie's flaws. Much of the camera-work helps tell the story (notice the scene where Pitt looks at Cotillard in the mirror).

Overall, I recommend it.
