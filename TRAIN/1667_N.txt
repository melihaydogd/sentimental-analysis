 Shambles!
As a huge LOTR fan from early childhood, it pains me to write this review - but they've completely missed it! The Lord Of The Rings is about, and should be about, and always has been about two things: story and atmosphere, both of which are missed completely in this film.As any other epic story, the plot needs time to develop and breathe, as such, thus creating a connection, on a very deep emotional level with the heroes. What the production team in this case had done, is crammed a huge story into three hours that make a VERY boring viewing. Boring, since the story has no credibility whatsoever when you don't understand why the heroes are where they are at, how they got there, or how long it took them to get there. All it leaves you with, is looking forward to the battle scenes, in which you will find yourself thinking: 'yeah right, whatever', on more than one occasion.On top of that, or rather because of all that, with the exception of Sir Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, the heroes seem ridiculous and pathetic and you are left feeling completely indifferent to them! Unheard of! Indifferent to the heroes of the LOTR! Oh dear, you got it SO wrong! Shame! Whenever I think about this film, I can't help but thinking about Gladiator, which I thought was fantastically written and executed. LOTR HAD the potential to be as good, but, and it pains me to say that, is not even in the same league.My money back please.
