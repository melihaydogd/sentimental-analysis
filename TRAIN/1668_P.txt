truly unique...and satisfying
There have been a lot of bad press and even worse reviews about this movie. I liked it. Why did I like it? I found it to be one of the most unique and visually entertaining movie I have ever seen. Most of the people who are giving this movie bad ratings are people who went into it with bad blood for it, so they looked for anything they could to rip it apart.

That had to be the case, because the movie that I saw was amazing. It was NOT Batman & Robin, like a lot of people are saying. It takes a simple concept and does so much with it. The creators of this film do so much with what they are given. The characters, unlike what previous posters have said, are very well developed, and there is much raw emotion displayed, especially between Halle and Benjamin, who fit together in this movie like hand in glove. And Sharon plays the baddest b-word you've ever seen!

Over all, this movie is a weird but creative combination between Ready to Wear, Spider-Man 2, Batman Returns, The Matrix, Batman Forever, City of Lost Children, Batman, and The Crow. Everything is satisfying in this film, even the music. I can't describe what a treat this film was, just because it was so unique. My advice is to go see it yourself. You may like it, you may not. But please give this movie a chance. Don't let other people decide for you.
