A movie that had potential... but failed!
Okay. Sow this might be the fastest movie description ever: 

1. A kid gets kidnapped. 

2. Mother sees it and follows the kidnappers. 

3. Car chase through the entire movie. 

4. In the end they get to the kidnappers house where the mother kills the kidnappers and saves her kid. 

Seriously, this movie HAD potential. And by that I mean that it COULD have been a movie in the same universe such as "Prisoners" (which is a hell of a good movie). However this is not. They would have needed a lot more mystery, a lot better dialogues to make it interesting. After half the movie passed in a car chase I started to get bored. 

And the ending, where the mother unveils the secret and kills the last kidnapper... I mean, the dialogue is so lame I almost laughed. Once again, Halle Berry is at least a descent actor, but she deserves better than this. Oh my God, how I have wasted time on a movie like this!
