It's like a black comedy but without too many punchlines

It was kind of funny. Not creepy or scary. The whole premise isn't deep to me at all, but I understand some people get a kick out of finding meaning in artsy movies so power to them. I also don't think I'm dumb for thinking the concept is bad but I digress.

I would recommend watching if you like a little silly movie that's mildly entertaining and might make you go "wtf lol" at some parts. Other than the plot, the cinematography was nice.
