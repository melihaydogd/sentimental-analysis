Have some adorable and eccentric cats which can be an enjoyable watch for feline lovers but looks like experimental cartoon from decades ago which it's not.
The Cat Returns (2002) can be adorable but to me, it is a huge disappointment. The concept is precious and amusing but the overall quality of the film made me think; is this really Studio Ghibli's production? The ridiculous and amateurish visuals make it looks like experimental cartoon from decades ago which it's not. It is too far from what I expected least from a spin-off of one of my favorite animated feature and from one of the world's most renowned studio.

However, this film does have some adorable and eccentric cats which can be an enjoyable watch for feline lovers like me but still, I can't say that I truly enjoy or even like this film. In fact, I am appalled to watch this. Most of the time, everything seems to be unpleasant, perhaps the art is not as beautiful or the storyline is not meaningful as the other films. Thankfully it's a pretty short film with a sweet ending.
