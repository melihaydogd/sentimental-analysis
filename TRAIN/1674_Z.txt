This is a good movie but it is NOT Pride and Prejudice!!
Any version of Pride and Prejudice gets a nod from me because the book is so dear to me but this is NOT Pride and Prejudice as Jane Austen wrote it; it's a good short story version of the book but the characters are not developed at all which is the cornerstone of Jane Austens' writing, it is hard to follow given the length of the movie and the characters do not say what is written in the book. Also missing is the two Bingley sisters which is capital to the book. The characters sometime speak the English of the day and sometimes not.  It is fast and furious at first with Mrs. Bennett being so bold as to go up to Mr. Darcy and introduce herself and her daughters; in that time she would never do that. Then it slows way down when Elizabeth visits Pemberly and I'm not sure why. And let's not forget the pond scene which is totally missing from this version. The pond scene and they way Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy make love just by their eyes after she performs at Pemberly is well worth watching the 1996 version.  If you want to see Pride and Prejudice as a movie do yourself and Jane a favor and watch the BBC 1996 version with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth not to mention Mrs. Bennett is definitely better hands down. Now that IS Pride and Prejudice as written by Jane Austen.  This version is not true to the spoken English as Jane wrote it; it goes in and out of the English spoken as in the book. It is not true to the story which is no fault of the movie because a movie needs to be 1 1/2 hours long which cannot do a Jane Austen book justice.  Please, take the time and let yourself get swept away by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehles' portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy. You will be glad that you did!!!!
