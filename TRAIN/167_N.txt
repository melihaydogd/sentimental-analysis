Save President, Kill Americans
I'm wondering why, it seems, nobody has noticed the aspect of this movie that I think is truly disturbing.

The reason the computer is going to eliminate American Government is saving American nation from inevitable grave danger resulting from the government's criminal actions. The government has become enemy of the nation, and the system, programmed to defend the Constitution and people, sees elimination of the criminal government as the only way to save the nation (doesn't this ring any bells?). The movie's main intrigue is in neutralizing this effort.

What's even more disturbing is that the question of whether it's right to doom the nation in order to rescue the government is not even presented as any kind of dilemma, though the characters are fully aware of the situation, and though the analytical capabilities of the computer are not questioned. The right move is still to save the government, no questions asked - and the main character heroically sacrifices himself in order to save POTUS - and thus to kill millions of Americans.

I thought it should be the other way around.
