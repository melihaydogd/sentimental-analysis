It feels.... forced
I understand that the Captain America comics have been political but this narrative of Sam, a famous avenger who saved the universe, is struggling with bank loans and getting stopped by the police due to race is a mockery of real world problems that people go through. It's a shame that marvel/disney thought this was the best way to deal with racial issues, when really it felt forced and was weak storytelling.
