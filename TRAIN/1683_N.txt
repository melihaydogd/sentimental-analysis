There is no excuse...
A good kids movie should have the ability to not only capture the child's interest, but also the parents'. Look at movies like the Incredibles, Madagascar, Shrek, and Up. They all have comedy that suits both children and adults. They are fun to watch for people of ANY age.

The argument that "this is just a kids movie" is not valid. Children deserve smarter movies than this. This movie is just a collection of horrible one-liners and the top 40 pop music chart songs that make up its soundtrack. There is nothing in this movie that has any sort of value, watch it if you like animals I guess. Or maybe not, cause after this movie I don't think I like Guinea pigs very much.
