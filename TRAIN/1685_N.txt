Kill Iris (Slow and Violent plz) and I'll give you 10
The plot of every season (after season 3): 1) Iris is nagging and acts as the boss's wife role commands 2) Villain appears and beats the crap out of Flash 3) Iris is worried and nagging 4) Barry tries to calm her down but it is still the beginning of the season so he fails 5) Somewhere in the middle of the season the rest of the crew are making they're appears as 50 year old teenagers. 6) Iris is still nagging and is in danger now 7) Barry calms her down and she says that she believes in THEM since THEY are the Flash. 8) Half of the last episode team flash (without Iris but she takes credit) manage to defeat the villain using team spirit and love. The other half of the season finale is boring celebration but at least Iris stopped nagging.Next season: Go to 1THIS IS WHY YOU GIVE THE HERO THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE JUST BEFORE THE SHOW ENDS, TO AVOID THE 85% OF CRAP AND NAGGING!!!
