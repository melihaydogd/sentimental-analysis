Very disappointed
I rarely write reviews, but just because the 'critics' in Belgium (and worldwide) were unanimously (ridiculously) enthusiastic I just feel the moral obligation of putting people back on their feet. They made it feel like the movie of the century, it felt like the 'Jurassic Park' of space movies... And as a die-hard sci-fi lover I really wanted to love this film, but sadly enough it now feels as cheap marketing gibberish. The graphics and audio are very good. Obviously. But just like Transformers: amazing cgi can't make up for a bàd movie. The story and whole movie actually failed me on every possible level. Without going into some pretty obvious mistakes, the story simply doesn't connect, it doesn't grow on me. It feels like just a chain of events with very simple/flat dialogs and no real build-up or climaxes. It's short, it's simple. Not only that, but it's actually a very sad overstatement to say 'this one of the most realistic space movies out there' as I'm constantly trying NOT to point out some big flaws to my wife so she would not completely be disappointed. That said, I kind of like Bullock in most of her movies. A nice unpretentious 'simple girl' can only score in my opinion, but my wife and I were constantly annoyed with her clumsiness, lack of 'hurry' (even while breathing co²), lack of courage, lack of education as an astronaut and so forth... But I guess that's a bad character/script in stead of a bad actress. She felt to me like what Jaden Smith does to most of his recent movies (which Is why i decided never to waste my time on him again). Anything but award-winning if you ask me :-/ But who am I. Watch the movie because society forces you, I don't care, but this is the last time I rely on IMDb ratings and 'real' Movie critics. Now it has 8.8, but in a year it will be down to 7.5, mark my words.
