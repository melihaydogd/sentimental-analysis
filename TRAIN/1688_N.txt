Just End Already
This movie was insanely boring. Two hapless, wannabe bank robbers hold up First Brooklyn Savings Bank to have it thwarted almost immediately. One of the robbers, Sonny (Al Pacino), besides being a bleeding heart criminal he was indecisive. For the next two hours there were a series of negotiations, phone calls, a whole lot of sweating, and little entertainment. I honestly don't know how this event became a movie.
