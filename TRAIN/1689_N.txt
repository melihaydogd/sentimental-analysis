Heat not so hot!
Hollywood has a new genre of films comedies that don't have any laughs in them. Actually this genre has been around for a while and this simply the latest in a long line. Sandra Bullock used to be a good actress but nowadays she is just another journeyman/woman making movies for a paycheck.The Heat was basically just a series of scenes from other (better) movies. We had the at odds with the boss scene,the scene that identified our two heroines as being misunderstood by all their colleagues. The getting drunk together bonding scene, the silly dance scene, the stepping on the toes of another law enforcement agency scene, the turning from a shrew into a mean mother scene,the captured by the bad guy scene, the escape from the bad guy scene, the capturing the bad guy in the nick of time and saving someone scene and finally the former screw up getting a medal scene.A collection of movie clich√©s without any empathy at all with the audience. Did we care about any of the heroines? I know I didn't. One a cop who swore all the time and treated her boss like dirt and the other the polar opposite.Oh how we laughed as these two found common ground and began to work together for the good of the community. No wait a minute. We didn't laugh as there was not one remotely funny scene in the whole movie.What a rubbish film.
