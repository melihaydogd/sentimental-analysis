the last western you ever need to see
Survival on the Western Frontier depended on a combination of cool heads and calculated risks among the wild fire reputations of deadly lore. The reality of the gun and rifle played out by Clint Eastwood amongst a small town, led by ruthless Gene Hackman. Characters names only add to the myth of a time when lawlessness was the way, even when doled out by authority. Women were disrespected as branded cattle in this town and men were only as good as their last shot, when character itself takes a back seat. Sickness meant death and honor lost a lot of battles. Long in the tooth yet deep in emotion, the truth of the small and vast Midwest is injected and exposed in "Unforgiven", the last western you ever need to see.
