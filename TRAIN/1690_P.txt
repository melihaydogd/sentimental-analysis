Fun!
I'm shocked by these lousy reviews. What were people's expectations? This is not Casablanca. Far better than the last two in the series, in line with the fun of the first one. It's a fun movie. A fun movie. Did I mention that it's a fun movie? So for anyone looking for some fun, this one's for you. For anyone who is interested in celebrity excess and knows what the Met Gala is, absolutely do not miss this. Don't take it seriously, but have fun!
