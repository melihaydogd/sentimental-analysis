Better than I was expecting!
So I am a huge horror fan, I was trying to find one I haven't watched. I don't usually give these kind of horrors a chance. So glad I did on this one!! I wasn't expecting it to be any good. At first I was thinking oh here we go another crap horror with a bunch of unheard of actors - stick with it! I absolutely loved this movie! There a few bad points, but overall a really entertaining horror and you're really rooting for the main character all the way through. The ending was better than I expected too. Glad they didn't ruin it.
