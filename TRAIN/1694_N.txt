Unbelievably overrated.
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1982. I was in my early twenties at the time so I could "understand" the things in this film (basically stereotypes). I didn't like the film then and the only reason I would suggest that anyone see it now is for '80's nostalgia. I always thought that this was an empty film pretending to be funny, which it isn't, and trying to have some kind of message. It's nothing but a cheap, trashy, BAD bad taste (as opposed to good bad taste, which I like) teen exploitation movie masquerading as something special. From it's reputation, one would think this is some work of brilliance. The characters were shallow and dull and I could never figure out how people love the ridiculous stoned out surfer character so much.Now...if this film had not taken itself seriously or, perhaps, been written as a put on or satire of high school or even teen movies and teen pop culture in general, circa 1982, such as the brilliant "Lord Love a Duck" did back in 1966, it very likely would have been something much better or even truly great.In my opinion, if you want to see something teen oriented which is far superior, see "Heathers" or definitely "Rock'n'Roll High School" or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off".
