Entertaining, but stupid!
I like the idea, when I was a kid, I like this series. But now, I find it stupid. Not the idea of the smart car, but more about the stories! But then, there are lots of stupid tv series that was great in those times, but become stupid right now. Usually they're still enjoyable at the beginning, and started getting stupid in the middle.
