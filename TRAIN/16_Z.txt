Mildly entertaining, but nothing more and ultimately boring.
I never was taken much with Kung Fu Panda as with a lot of reviewers on here. Dreamworks have come up with some pretty impressive animations over the years though my favourites being Shrek 1 and 2. But the company just isn't in the same league as Pixar. Anyway Kung Fu Panda I found mildly enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong I chuckled at a few parts throughout and Jack Black puts in an incredible effort of bringing a lot of charm to Po. The cast is great including Black with Dustin Hoffman (Shifu), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Seth Rogen (Mantis) and Lucy Lui (Viper). They all lend good voice-overs to the characters and even the story was OK.

But I couldn't connect with many of the characters, the fight sequences if you can call them that were choreographed surprisingly badly, the script wasn't sharp enough with the comedy as the jokes weren't all that funny and the animation wasn't as impressive as previous animations. Despite that though it's not the worst animation I've seen and it was at least trying to entertain you and the bottom line is kids will absolutely love it anyway. But it's not a movie I would care to watch again.
