Overall boring, unfunny, and plain unintelligent
I cant believe this movie. This is what you get when you mix a lazy, unoriginal idea with overall a boring plot. Im not going to say anything for you, but nearly every joke in the movie, you probably have heard a million times. This makes you not even smile. The movie is VERY immature, cracking a body joke every other minute, and has a very lame plot, which we have seen a million times, where they are trying to save the forest, blah blah. The mix of animation and real life characters just makes it embarrassing to look at. Also, the 3d is crude and doesn't have any interesting moments. Granted, the actors are talented, but this movie is a piece of filth.
Save yourself the trouble, and pick another movie. Even kids wont find this poor movie amusing.
