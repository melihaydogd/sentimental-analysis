Disappointment even for the mildest F&F fan
This movie started off really well, however, it was set off course after the action started. I have to warn those that watched the trailers on television, because they spoiled every exciting scene from the movie. I would not consider myself an avid fan, but I have followed the series ever since the first movie and I would be the first one to tell you that this movie is a major disappointment. After Tokyo drift, the director relied heavily on action and random fillers to please the audience while leaving the fans frustrated and confused. And since when did the acronym "F&F" turn from fast and furious to fast and fighting? This series has started it's roots from racing and formed into another predictable action movie.Now, to the ridiculous part of the review. The last scene with the cargo jet is beyond unrealistic. This scene was around 15 minutes long and I would like to point out that the take-off speed of a vast jet like that is around 150-200 mph (not to mention they had to increase speed in order to take-off due to the added weight). The runway must been around 50 miles long because they were on there for literally 15 minutes traveling at an average speed of 150mph+. And don't even get me started with the whole Gisele dying scene. The director got rid of her faster than all those V-8 powered engines put together!I pointed out a bit of information what the reviewer "carl-walster" missed. He did an amazing job to point out how really ridiculous the movie really was. I have a great imagination, but this movie was too difficult to comprehend. And how could some of these other reviewers say this was the best of fast and furious? That's blasphemous!
