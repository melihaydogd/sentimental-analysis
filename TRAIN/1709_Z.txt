It's great, but I wish it was more serious.
It was surprisingly comedic film. I think most of humor don't fit in the film. As for everything other, the special effects were amazing. I loved when the film was about the survival of the martian, but after halfway through it started to drag, not suprising the lenght of it is 2h24min, I'd say 20 minutes too long. Still, I can recommend this film, the protagonist was great and I loved watching how he was trying to survive in mars.
