Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel
ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS 2! By: Steffi

You should see Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 . The movie is funnier than ever! I'm impressed of their job in the movie. The characters are Alvin,Simon,Theodore, & Elvanmor,Brittany,& Jeanette. My favorite character is Theodore because she is cute

he is also a little fat. and loves his family like Alvin,& Simon. and he likes Elvanmor. for her friends. One reason is I like this movie is because they add many emotions I can think of like sad, happy,annoyed,desperate,and angry. When I saw the movie I laughed so hard I almost cried but not for sadness.This movie includes props and pranked stuff.

THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!

They mostly include singing and dancing. The movie is so cool I didn't even finish my popcorn because I was so hooked in the movie when the movie was brand new. I would recommend 10 out of 10 stars! You should see Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 I recommend you go! Come on go!
