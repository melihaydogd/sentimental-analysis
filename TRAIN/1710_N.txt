Worst Film Ever? Possibly.
What did I miss? Well, for starters, I missed the last half of the movie because it was so bad I had to ask TiVo to delete it.

This movie was so terrible I assumed that IMDb would be spilling over with bad reviews. Will Farrell was trying so hard, but falling so short. Bob Newhart provided the only 3 laughs in the first 2 minutes of the intro, it was downhill after that.

Christmas movies get under my skin anyway, but this one was the worst one. I know I'm just ranting here, but I had to get this off my chest.

The scene with Bob Newhart and Will Farrell looking at Santa's sleigh and the rocket boosters was like a comedy lesson that Bob was trying to teach to Will, but to no avail. The student just wasn't getting it.

Bob: "See, Will, uh, comedy is just a matter of, uh, uh, tim-ing!" Will: "YA MEAN LIKE THIS! HUH? DO YA? DO YA?" Bob: "Uh, no, Will. No, I don't. Hey, let's just forget it, okay?" The plot just seemed to drudge along like a molasses sandwich. I just couldn't take it anymore. Especially not to see good actors like Bob Newhart, James Caan, Ed Asner get dragged into it. It's not that I hate Will Farrell, I think he's okay, but this movie just stank.
