Lame movies don't get a teaser so spoiler intended.
I watched Shaun of the dead (or Shawn always confuse the spelling) a while back. People, after watching the movie, started saying it was a refreshing comedy and very very funny. Well I took a look and it was mildly amusing but most of the advertisements (my buddies should probably work for media marketing) by mu friends fell short. This movie however, the trailer did not grab me but I was willing to watch as the previous movie made was a decent movie. I should have realized that the trailer and the previews for this movie was somewhat desperate as many movies get (Mr. Deeds for eg.) and I decided to watch it. I am glad I wasn't paying for this flick but I can tell you that this movie is more chaotic and very plaid. How the hell do you get distracted for an hour and a half with popcorn? that was the first for me. The jokes are too mild and there was nothing good about the story either. I mean if no one can see that the main chief of the the HQ along with some other key ppl are the villains in the movie (it's OK if you don't guess the few of the townsfolk as conspirators) then you need to put the crack pipe down. This movie was very disappointing and just went down the hole further. The only funny part I saw was was towards the ending where he kicks an old lady in the face. Hence my score for this movie was a 4 but after proof reading my comment the movie deserved to have two more points taken off so hence it is a 2 star movie which most likely should be watched free. No offense to anyone who likes the movie but I still think its not worth putting your pop corn down and watch at the movie until it ends.
