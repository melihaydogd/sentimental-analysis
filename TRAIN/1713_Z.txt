Overhype much?
This is emotional manipulation at its core. And the problem is that it's terribly executed, withou any sort of originality or respect for the audience. There are creative ways to get an emotional response from viewers besides slow-motion and a sad sountrack in "key moments". The movie was competently shot and i can't complain about the performance of the main character (on the other hand, the little girl was terrible and the furthest from fluid and believable, even in child acting standards). If you can see through the emotions the filmmaker is shoving down your throat, this is a pretty underwhelming experience.
