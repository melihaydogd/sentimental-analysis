What you'd expect...literally.
There isn't a scene, line or word that is unique and unexpected.No one behaves like that at work (all super-happy and ever-supportive). And come on... A super hot single dance instructor gets rejected from dates all the time? I smell bull****. Similarly, an attractive, middle class white male cannot find love until she literally falls into his arms?These Christian movies are honestly so horribly written that it's incredible anyone, even those with faith, could watch them and believe a word of it.
