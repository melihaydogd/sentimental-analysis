Great movie of the 80's...and other decades!
I think there's always someone somewhere in the world, with some music of this movie in his head. That shows how remarkable it was this movie, for many generations, especially my own, the ones who born in the 70's. But what I never imagined was that my young kid would be one day sitting at the table, having breakfast and singing "I've had the time of my life, and I never felt like this before...". He's only 8, for God's sake! The performances are great, the dancing is amazing, the directing swelling and the musics just unforgettable. I must admit this is not a hell of picture, but I'll be damned if this is not a good show to look at and just enjoy for two hours. I guarantee that when the credits appear you'll be asking someone to shut the lights off and dance with the love of your life. Like any good movie, but not great, there's a sequel to ruin the business. So don't make any mistakes. The first one is the real thing, and the real thing sees no boundaries, no classes and no differences in all of us. That's love, and this show sure tell us that.
