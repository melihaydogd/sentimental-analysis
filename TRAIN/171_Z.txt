Fun but familiar
Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual.
