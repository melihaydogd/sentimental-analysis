What else did you expect?
I walked in the cinema expecting fast cars, street racing, crazy cop chases, drifting and explosions and that's exactly what I got!

This film is called "Need for Speed" and is based on a video game. This alone tells us not to expect character development, genius plot twists and memorable dialogues. This films delivers exactly what it set out to deliver.

If you like fast and beautiful cars, this is for you. If you like crazy stunts and cars chases, this is for you. If you enjoyed getting chased by the cops in the video game, this is for you.

Go to the cinema expecting the above and you'll have an excellent time.
