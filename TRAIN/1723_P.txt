I love this movie
It's been a long time ago that I had so much fun watching a movie like this one. If you are familiar with the work of director Donald G. Jackson you are really surprised. Hell comes to Frogtown has a real story, great acting, excellent make-up effects, good camera work, a real cut and it is really a pleasure to watch it.

Wrestling Legend Roddy Rowdy Piper is fantastic as Sam Hell, Conan's female fighting mate Sandahl Bergmann and the beautiful and sexy Cec Verrell as Centinella team up perfectly with him. Western B-movie legend Rory Calhoun and B-movies best bad guy William Smith complete this excellent cast.

You think this movie can't be much funnier in the first 30 Minutes but when they come to Frogtown and you hear William Smiths voice behind one of the masks you fell from your chair laughing and laughing.

Beneath The Roller Blade Seven this is Donald G. Jacksons best work. I really love this movie! Watch it and enjoy it.
