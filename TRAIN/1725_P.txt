Fantastic Direction in this Indie Gem
I had the great fortune of seeing Yes, God, Yes in the Emerging Director section of the St. Louis International Film Festival. The film is pitch perfect, and lead actress Natalia Dyer (Stranger Things) carries the film with tension and humor. I will watch this film again, and certainly recommend it as often as possible. Director Karen Maine's mastery keeps this film moving forward with precision and never misses a beat.
