GREAT MOVIE! (For Young Viewers)
Earth To Echo (In my opinion) was the best movie I've ever seen. Now, being that I'm only 14, could mean a huge difference for the older age groups. I honestly thought the movie was meant to lean toward younger people, but older age groupings might enjoy the movie. I still wrap myself around the main point of the movie. I don't want to say anything, because it would give it away, but I found it to be a very inspirational film. I think anyone who is 12-30 would highly enjoy this movie! The movie will really impact someone who thinks that Long-Distance friendship/relationships can't happen. I give it a 10/10 just because it was just that good!
