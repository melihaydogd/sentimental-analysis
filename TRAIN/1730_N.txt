Meh. Overrated
I think this is a poor facsimile of the film noir genre with main characters that have no rapore whatsoever.

And why Danny DeVito is in this movie is beyond me. He is so mis-cast, just like all the main stars.

The writing is poor and the acting is stiff.

And as I've said about the directing, it's a poor facsimile of a film noir or neo noir.
