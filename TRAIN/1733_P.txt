Much more to this film
So many people are saying they didn't like this because it wasn't really "horror". While that statement in itself is true, it is to an extent. Horror itself can be defined in different forms (fear, disgust and utter shock) This film delivers that different something. The main lead is living the constant fear and anxiety during the iran- Iraq conflict. Stress and trauma are no joke and what they can do to a person's state of mind is terrifying. If you want a standard, pure horror film, yea look elsewhere. You won't be able to appreciate the film for what it is if that's what you go into looking for. Give it a shot with an open mind and see what you think! *Shout out to that sheet scene. I just loved how it looked.
