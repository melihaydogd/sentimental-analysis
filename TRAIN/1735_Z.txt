I liked Dogs Playing Poker better than the Pollock
Affleck plays - without stretching his range - an "highly functioning" autistic accountant with combat skills and a sniper's eagle eye. He cooks books for the worst criminals in the world and he is super-rich, but he must hide his ill-begotten stuff in a trailer (for tax evasion purposes).

He also has a complex family history and an investigator hot on his tracks. Progressing through a series of disconnected scenes and moving back and forward on the time line, denouement occurs in a rather predictable way. In fact, every single loose end is tied at the end, without adding to the quality of the story.

Since the movie industry is male dominated, both on the production and on the audience side, it is easy to see how "highly functioning" autism is of huge interest. It implies super-human skills without the need of any emotional connection. This is bound to be successful with that part of the audience who likes super-hero flicks, with high body count and a bit of a twist.

What I found most annoying was the pretentiousness of the plot to be somehow linked to reality. "Normal" autism is way more common than "highly functional" and a lot less pleasant on a daily basis. However, this movie would have us believing that having an autistic child is a blessing and that they can over-smart "normal" people.

Besides, the movie dragged on for what seemed forever, with lots of explanations and sub-plots that were unnecessary. A tighter screenplay and a less fanciful main character would have made the story more interesting - albeit pushing it into super-hero territory, where it should go.
