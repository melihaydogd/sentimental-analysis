Beautifully done!!
The Story: Such romantic movie. The story is well written. The story, the music & the dance work so well together. No scene is unnecessary.

The Directing: Both of the main casts have beautiful voice and dance so well together. Great chemistry between them. It is always refreshing to see a movie done in musical way. Definitely could feel how beautiful their love for each other. Well done~
