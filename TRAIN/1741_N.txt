What was that?
Over-long and without a plot of any substance, this is another movie about Hollywood, like La La Land, that Hollywood loves to love, but rarely delivers on the promise for the rest is us. Despite good performances by Robbie, DiCaprio and Pitt it drifts along, and on and on. Maybe I missed something....
