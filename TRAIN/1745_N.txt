The film's success proves there are a lot of people on antidepressants
That's the only explanation I have in order to explain why such a sucky, corny and unfunny movie was such a huge hit at the b.o. and now on home video. So many people's brains are so numbed by drugs that something as awful as ELF can easily be considered a classic.

What's remarkable is how unfunny and predictable ELF was. I knew things were going to happen several minutes even before they were going to happen (for example, the short writer...). And the film's corny attitude is so overwhelming, I cringed throughout the movie. This film is so corny, it could supply a years worth of high fructose corn syrup for Coca Cola, Pepsi, 7-up, Dr Pepper, Tab, RC Cola, Orange Crush, Kool-Aid AND every Kelloggs cereal in production!!! This film is so divorced from reality that it's unfunny. Yes, it's a fantasy. I'm aware of that but the employees at the mail room of the Empire State building are working on Christmas eve? I mean, come on!

And I felt so bad for James Caan.

If you like Will Ferrell's shtick, you'll probably like this movie. But for those, like me, who see Ferrell's shtick as something utterly annoying, avoid this movie at all cost!
