I understand why you liked it but I hated it

I hated this movie. I never got into the world or the characters. Perhaps it was the Mad Max of old and my nostalgia for that world but this was so different and less real than the world of the original Max. Max was leaden. He seemed almost irrelevant and I couldn't care for him. Furiousa was better and brought some interest to the adventure. Nux was just Nicholas Hoult in bad make-up. I don't generally like movies with endless fight and action scenes and this pushed that genre to the extreme. In the end it was plot free, character free nonsense.

But. I can understand the appeal both to the action fan and to wider cinema audiences. The visuals were stunning, the world was unique and the pace and intensity was startling. Immerse yourself in the world and the action and I could understand this could reach 10 out of 10 proportions. I never got there and sadly hated every minute. Just a personal view.
