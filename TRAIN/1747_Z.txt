Zinda Bhaag: A nice effort for revival of Pakistani Cinema
Zinda Bhaag..I watched this movie with my friend at Super Cinema Abbot Road Lahore.I would like to praise the effort that Meenu and Farjad put into, making this film for the revival of Pakistani Cinema. Its a very nice effort.Naseer UD Din shah was a treat to watch. We should keep in mind that we have not Big Screen actors as compared to Bollywood and Hollywood, but the new cast done well.More hard work is required in technical departments like sound, cinematography, screen play.Give it a try.
