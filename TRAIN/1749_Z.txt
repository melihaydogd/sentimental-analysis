You could have it so much better (with Alan Moore)
'V for Vendetta' is a well intended film for today's audience. As many other science fiction movies, like Matrix or Blade Runner, it presents a could be-world in which freedom is an underrated right, and a character who is willing to put things upside-down. So, as every dystopia attempts, it makes you think. It is interesting in that the film is absolutely not a follow up to Neo's special effect nightmares. In fact there's only one sequence that will satisfy the people of that likes. But regrettably neither the film is well directed nor did the Wachowskis write a screenplay that raises questions in depth. The filming language is extremely poor in some sequences, like those of the burning birth of V at Larkhill, or the ones about the lesbian couple. A somewhat shallow film, though the strength of the comic books remains in the character of V. Besides, it's always pleasure to see Ms. Portman and hear Julie London's 'Cry me a river'.
