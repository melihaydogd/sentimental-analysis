Cheesy, unrealistic and did I mention awful?
One of the crappiest movies i have seen in the past few years. Implemented lame story and even worse logic. I went in with really low expectations because Evil Dead was sold out and even with my low expectations...ended up my final thoughts on this movie was much lower than that. Do not see this stink hole of a movie.I should have left 30 mins in, I regret not leaving, I never leave a movie ever but I wanted to this time. What makes it even worse, I went to see the new Evil Dead movie which was sold out and thought I would take a chance on Olympus Has Fallen.. You know what is even more painful? I bought an extra ticket by mistake. Man I hated it.Olympus Has Fallen is correct, fallen into my top 10 list of worst movies I have ever seen. It was plain ridiculous. I am contemplating sticking a knitting needle deep in my ear to remove the part of my brain that is holding the memory of this movie.
