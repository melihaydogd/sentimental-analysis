Entertaining but forgettable
This film is a comedy about 4 gay youngsters making a pact to lose their virginity before the summer ends.

It clearly is a gay version of "American Pie", with many references such as the webcam, the quiche, the parents waltzing into the room just to name a few.

The plot is rather mediocre. It does not feel original enough to the point where it feels like as if I was watching American Pie. The film tries to send a message that men should be comfortable about their bodies, but the message does not get across well. The film has many gross scenes as well, such as having extensive farts. There are plenty of sex scenes, and even a masturbation scene, which qualifies it to be a porn movie. Though they are great eye candy, I feel that there is too much emphasis on sex in this film, which may bring the wrong message to young people that sex is everything.

The end result is that the film is entertaining, but only on a very superficial level. It is a forgettable film.
