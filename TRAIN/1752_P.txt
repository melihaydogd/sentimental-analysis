This movie is awesome &
5.6 out of 10 is an insult what because all you Korean loving fan boys don't want an American version ? . What about all the people who don't watch foreign films...are we suppose to miss out on this awesome story ? well thanks god for Spike Lee to remake it & thanks to Josh Brolin for an awesome performance...he lost wait put on wait went all out for this role . Believe me people the true rating for this movie should be similar to the original OldBoy 8.4 , I read one of the reviews for the original & it said for 5 minutes after you just sat their with your mouth open in awe & that's how I felt after watching the remake so don't listen to the haters go & see this movie especially if you haven't seen the original & were put off by the low rating on here .
