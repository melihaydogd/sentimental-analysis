I Laughed During This Movie, But It Wasn't Good!
It was good to see Chenoa Maxwell, the girl from Have Plenty, in this movie. Why was every character in this movie a jerk? Why did that crazy guy kill Sky at the end of the movie? He should have killed that Phillipine man who took his fly friend from him. And speaking of his fly friend, that was some on the most monotonous acting I have ever seen in my entire life! Blair Underwood was a lucky man. He got to cheat on his wife with a fly woman and get with a fly woman! And his wife did the exact same thing! She cheated on him with an ex boyfriend who happens to be a record executive. And what was the point of putting Sky's cousin Tracy in this movie. He was pointless throughout the movie. And the "rapper" who tried to talk to the fly lady with children. There were so many stereotypes in this movie! And we should have known that the cigarette smoking lady was going to sing a solo at Sky's funeral.
