A must-see for anyone who cares.
This was definitely the best, in both visual effects and quality of content, out of the Zeitgeist series. A few animated shorts provide welcomed comic relief throughout the 2-hour and 40-minute film.As a sociologist, I particularly appreciated the first half of the movie which was dedicated to discussing human "nature", behavior, and social pathology. With the basic groundwork laid for understanding how humans *do* have the potential to create a massive shift in our current social/cultural paradigm, the film goes on to offer the potential design and physical layout of a more efficiently functioning social system. Anyone who is concerned with the current state of our global society should watch this film... and then share it with a friend. (And anyone who's not concerned with the current state of our global society should probably read about international news more often.)
