 Poor movie
I don't know why other people think this movie is so great. I think they're happy that Tolkien's classic has been brought to the big screen. Cinematography, and special effects were only average, story was to me rather boring, characters were artificial and lacked believability, so why the high ratings ? I saw this movie in the theaters with my girlfriend, and after seeing this movie I was rather apologetic to my girlfriend because she didn't enjoy it, and I know that I didn't enjoy it. It's an epic, I give it that, but most people in this movie just had sad expression or no expressions at all. I just couldn't get any energy out of this movie.The movie was such a disappointment that I canceled my plans to see all its sequels.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1/10 was it was better than Catwoman, and I could tell that the director and actors put in a sincere effort into making Tolkien's classic come to life.
