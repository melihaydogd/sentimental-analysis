Exploitative, unfocused; it should have been a documentary
A bit traumatised for a moment afterward. Rather exploitative, filming it in gimmicky 3D. It made the cinematography of the mountains even more impressive, but during dramatic moments, it seemed out of place (plus, it seemed distracting just to be wearing those silly glasses during those scenes) .

The immense, massive scale and impact of the mountain itself clashed with what was the smaller scale horror the hikers were enduring. I wasn't expecting some generic action movie, but it really seemed like those two elements worked against each other.

Effectively horrifying scenes of the approaching storm itself, completely enveloping the mountain and unfortunate climbers, and of hikers almost casually tumbling over the mountainside. Good acting all around, but also an unfocused narrative; an All-star cast with no central character. Almost everyone seemed to have only an extended cameo appearance, but nothing more.

Parts of it I enjoyed, probably couldn't watch it a second time, though.
