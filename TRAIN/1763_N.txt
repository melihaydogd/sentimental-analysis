I don't get it
I tried so hard to like this movie. I understand - it's a classic, and anyone who loves movies should swear by this film because it's this and that and the other and it can cure warts and remove cellulite and fix your car... An hour into it, my date and I were so lost that we turned it off. The acting was great, of a caliber we don't see much of in modern movies, but the storyline just didn't sit with me. I had no idea what was going on half the time (the legal aspects, for instance) because I don't have an intimate knowledge of the time period or location, and when I did understand what was happening (the affair), I wasn't sure why this movie had become classic. I mean no offense to the people who love this movie. I just wish I could have loved it, too.
