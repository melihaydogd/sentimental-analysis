Third season not worth the wait....may contain spoilers.
Loved first season, tolerated second season, disliked third season. Just did not understand the third season's total lack of attention to security of a serial killer. This was even after his confessions and after he led the authorities to where he was holding his latest kidnapped victim. Basically he was left in his hospital bed unguarded and unrestrained. His nurse (who resembled all his victims) was in charge of the alleged serial killer and she became very protective of him, seriously? Of course she also was "under his spell". Plus his latest kidnap victim is also in the hospital unguarded and in his adjoining hospital room. It was so ridiculous that it became a comedy of errors....and eventually I started rooting for the serial killer!! I watched the last two episodes of the third season mostly on fast forward. Ugh.
