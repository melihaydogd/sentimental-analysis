Alan Moore definitely saves face.
Dear Larry and Andy Wachowski, I want my money back. You sold me V For Vendetta, a story of ideological revolution with a hero who was equal parts William Shakespeare, Alexander Dumas, and Abbie Hoffman. The product you delivered was certainly G For Garbage, and the "hero" you offered in the movie was the bastard child of MTV, Osama Bin Laden and Michael Moore. Instead of taking a few liberties with the plot as most movies based on comics do, you felt it necessary to rewrite the entire story. This was certainly NOT the V For Vendetta I remember reading and re-reading. This was, simply put, one of the most dumbed-down pieces of garbage put on film I've seen in recent memory. Alan Moore made a very wise decision by asking for his name not to be put on this travesty.
