Why Spike Lee did this ?
I really liked Spike Lee's with Do the Right Thing; but even more Jungle Fever and thought Malcom X was OK but not extraordinary. After that I saw a few others I liked and others not so much but never really disappointed until this mess.OLDBOY (the Korean original) is a quite complex tale that could only be believable because of certain small details and a really twisted ending. Lee's version, changed many of those details making the events more far more difficult to accept and forcing a politically correct ending on an absolutely sick story.Even worse is the acting. Josh Brolin lacks any expression or charisma or anything that can make you root for him. Sharlto Copley is a little better but her character was changed to a clown. In fact is a little difficult to find it threatening. Elizabeth Olsen is the only exception. He gives an great sweetness to her character that becomes quite sensual in his sex scene with Brolin. It is a pity the changes from the original left her character loss on the end.The problem here is not the comparison with the original (which is a masterpiece) but that whatever they tried to do here was a misstep. In brief; do not lose any time with this; a couple of good scenes do not make a movie
