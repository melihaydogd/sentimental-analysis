Terrible script, outstanding action scenes.
The screenplay of this movie is really bad. I know this is "based" on a true story, but having a real story to tell seemed to turn into an excuse to freely describe the events in a non-realistic and non-interesting way. So this story could be very true, but for the way it's told, it really doesn't make any sense. One new scene every 2 or 3 minutes; 1 minute conversations in which the characters meet, describe the situation and decide what to do; unknown characters popping up in the middle of the story without explanations. There's huge lack of elaboration on everything but on the action scenes, cause the director seemed to take those shots seriously and dedicate the time is needed to make them outstanding. Really, when the action is there, this movie rocks. This is a true story in which action is crucial, but occupies probably only between 25% and 30% of the playing time. The other 70% is extremely flawed. By watching it, you can tell the director disregarded everything but the action here, and the truth is that when there's no action, this movie doesn't make any sense, and that's something you don't fix neither by having true events, nor having DeNiro in the credits. You have to take time to describe the events to the audience. The excellent action parts are not enough to save this one.
