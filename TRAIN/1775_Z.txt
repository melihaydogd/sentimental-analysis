Scale of 1 to ten -> 3.8 ,quite a shame too...
Well, I had quite some low expectations from this one, but after about 10 minutes, they raise, actually starting to enjoy it, wanting more, it seemed better than average. Sadly, after 40 minutes, it all rolls down the hill, deep down, probably it's when they stopped trying...OK, Zombex: the effects are really cheap, I mean all the head shots and guns firing, CGI, weak ones too, the dialogue was acceptable in the first half, quite natural I might say, the story, absolutely nothing new but then again it is a zombie movie, and some half decent characters. Quite a contrast here, cause again, the first 40 minutes, pretty much everyone embraced logic and took normal decisions, after that, they all act like they are indeed part of a zombie movie...dumb dumb and dumb. The ending didn't do much either, quite sad, quite pointless, like a journey that started promising and ending just because it was time. Brought nothing new whatsoever.Therefore, I rated it 4, almost average zombiefest, but not quite there. Would I recommend such a thing? Nope, not even the cast can save this one. But then again if you are a zombie maniac, you might enjoy it, still, ALMOST average zombex!Cheers!
