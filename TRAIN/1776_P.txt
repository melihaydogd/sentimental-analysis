A masterpiece of all times
You can better experience The Wall as a movie when there is a preceding knowledge of the Album, released in 1979 and still considered a masterpiece of all times.  The Wall tells the story about Mr. Pink (last name) Floyd, who painfully struggles to find an answer for which he cannot even state the question. Half reality, half surrealism, every single sight and sound constitutes a portrayal of a decadent, post-war society that inevitably leads to the horror of segregation, totalitarianism and exacerbated nationalism.  Like a modern Kafka, Roger Waters anticipated social phenomena that shattered diverse regions, right after they shouted `liberty!' to the world.
