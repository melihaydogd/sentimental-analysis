A Waste of Skill
Many people believe &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; is a good film. It is not. Tarantino failed to make it into anything but violence and the combination of music and camera-work. The screenplay was poor, but the lines, or at least the way they were written, were convincing. This film has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and I use the word &quot;redeeming&quot; loosely about movies. Without a doubt, many movies are about nothing and are good. &quot;Dogs&quot; is about a group of men who messed up a bank robbery and went to a warehouse to talk about things and get very angry at each other.<br/><br/>Many find the movie hip, but at best the movie itself is not hip, the pitiful characters may seem to be, but really the only hip character is Mr. White, played by Harvey Keitel. Anyone that thinks supposed professionals who can&#39;t do their jobs right, swear a great deal over nothing, get very tense, and lose their cool on a dime work well for a movie centered around nothing in particular are wrong. A very weak film.
