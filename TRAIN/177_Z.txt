Boyd and Lombard try hard to thaw the ice
Made in 1929 when talking films were still finding their feet, most of the action in this claustrophobic film takes place in an abandonded church.

Several people take shelter from a snow storm when their bus breaks down. Carol Lombard plays Billie, "the girl", who is being taken back to prison. Owen Moore plays "the detective". Diane Ellis (who tragically died in 1931 on her honeymoon) plays "the Kid".Handsome William Boyd plays "the boy", an escapee, who at first is gruff but then becomes a big help to the snow bound inmates. He and Lombard fall for each other and have real chemistry in their scenes together.

It is short on action and very long on talking (and corny dialogue at that) but at 70 minutes it is mercifully short.

Carole Lombard was at the start of a super career when she made this film. She had been in a few shorts including "The Campus Vamp" and "The Swim Princess".

William Boyd had been a successful leading man in the 20s and the next year (1930) would see him in his first western - "The Painted Desert" - after which he would have a long career as Hopalong Cassidy. He proves, in this film, he had a flair for dialogue and a very natural acting style. Both he and Lombard try hard to rise above the trite dialogue. It is clear that they are destined for bigger things.

Owen Moore, who had been in films from the earliest days and was Mary Pickford's first husband plays the detective.

Billy Bevan, a silent comic, was the bus driver.
