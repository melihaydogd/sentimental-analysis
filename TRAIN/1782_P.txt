Well-Crafted Heist Flick!
Not one of S. Peckinpah's masterworks but one hell of a crime thriller. Steve McQueen is perfect as the cool, professional Doc and although Ali MacGraw (Steve's next wife) is breezily gorgeous she doesn't have the chops to make her character (Carol) too believable.  Al Lettieri is creepier than he was in THE GODFATHER and Richard Bright (THE GODFATHER as well) has a nice bit as a small-timer.  Ben Johnson has credibility as does Dub Taylor later.  Throw in authentic Western icon Slim Pickens and you have a nice Southwest crime drama.A 7 out of 10.  Best performance = Steve McQueen.  He's very good with weapons and cars as he earlier proved.  THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS are Peckinpah's masterpieces, but this is well worth a trip to the movies! Junior Bonner (a totally different type of sensibility) is also a fine film.
