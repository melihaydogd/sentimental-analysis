Finest film-making
Skull Island, as Jackson has re-imagined it, is one of the most sinister locations ever to be presented to film audiences. Its inhabitants are no longer corny but very believable, frightening savages. For anyone who has read James Michener's "Hawaii", specifically his narrative of the diaspora from the carnage of Bora Bora and the other South Pacific islands, this portion of the film strikes a chord. There truly were natives who acted in such unimaginatively cruel ways, and of course this fits in perfectly with their having been ravaged by Kong and other beasts. That is one example of the brilliant re-conception of this story.

But at the heart of it all is the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow, and it is here that Jackson, Watts, Andy Serkis, everyone at WETA, and his screen writing partners truly pull off the miraculous. These are some of the most sincerely rendered moments of any film, the result of heartfelt love and compassion for these characters and this material. It is something that I do not know if we will see again at the movies in quite the same way.

Peter Jackson's King Kong is some of the finest film-making I have ever seen. It will be his masterpiece. You MUST see this film in the theater. I am very, very cynical about current films, and I did not particularly like Return of the King. Rarely has a subject and a director been so perfectly matched as with this latest film. Jackson has crafted the best remake ever.
