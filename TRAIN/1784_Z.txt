An Odd Film
A man (Harry Dean Stanton) is found in the desert after four years.  In case you were wondering, yes, there really is such a place as Paris, Texas, and it is a city of around 25,000 people. Why exactly Wim Wenders (or more accurately playwright Sam Shepard) chose it (besides the interesting name) is anyone's guess. Probably no reason in particular.  It is interesting to see that this film seems to have had more influence on musicians than other filmmakers. Irish rock group U2 cite Paris, Texas as an inspiration for their album "The Joshua Tree". Scottish bands Travis and Texas both took their names from this film. And late musicians Kurt Cobain and Elliott Smith claimed this was their favorite movie of all time.
