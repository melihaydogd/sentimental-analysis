I Launched My Lunch...
...at the screen this film was so bad.This is, arguably, the worst romantic comedy ever made. There is no witty repartee between characters, no situational comedy, no anything. Well, I take that back; you do get Terry Bradshaw's backside, but that is so gratuitous that it's not even worth a chuckle. Simply terrible film-making. If you read this, and still see the movie, you must hate yourself -- no other explanation would suffice.As others have commented, the only attempted source of laughs in the script is the animal humor -- a few pointless, childish "jokes" where Matthew M. gets "attacked" by a chipmunk, dolphin, etc. It's as if the script was written by a four year-old -- and a wooden four year-old at that. It's hard to imagine a movie being *worse* than this. No way is this a 5.5 star flick -- even Sarah Jessica Parker could only rate this a 2-star effort. BE WARNED!!
