Awful, awful, and awful.
Wow... rarely does a movie come out that is so terrible that it deserves to be filed in the awful category. Oldboy nails it! I never saw the original but if it's anything like the deplorable and disgusting plot of this one then I'm glad I haven't seen it. What ever happened to having at least a little integrity and moral standard in our entertainment? This movies "twist" in the end is so reprehensible, disgusting, and absolutely unnecessary! Up until the twist, I would've giving this film a 4-5 for its silliness - how can one become a martial arts master by watching cheesy Kung fu movies for twenty years? My recommendation... Not even worth the $1.30 at the Redbox. Certainly not worth your time.
