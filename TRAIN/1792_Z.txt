If you think graphic violence is entertaining, this is your film
Well, I guess over the years, the Rambo character has been fully uncovered and developed to the extent that the only thing left to make a movie out of is the violence. I am a Rambo fan, but not a fan of the sacrificing good writing and editing in favor of Peckinpah/Tarantino type graphic violence. I did not find this dark film entertaining.
