Pacino's Greatest Ever Performance
Not only is one of our greatest actors of all-time at the top of his game in this great film, but one of our greatest directors, Sidney Lumet is also on the top of his game. Dog Day Afternoon tells the story of a bank robbery gone awry. The planner is a former bank employee named Sonny, who needs money to pay for his boyfriend's sex change operation. When you hear that plot, you think comedy. Indeed, this movie is a black comedy, however, as we see in various scenes, it is also very serious. In fact, the tragic ending is a sober dose of real tragedy. Pacino makes this movie, he is that bankrobber, way over his head, trying in vain to make everything work out in the end. However, Sonny and Sal (his bankrobbing buddy) are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, I am glad I was able to see them there, trying in vain to make it all work out.
