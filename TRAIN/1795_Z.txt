Great Movies have endings
This Movie had great potential as being one of the great classic movies of all time. We were wrapped up in it from the beginning to the credits, but it did not end.

I'm trying to figure out why there was a sheriff Bell character, as he didn't add anything to the story except one-liners.

Don't get me wrong. Tommy Lee Jones' work was simply great. As was Brolin's, Bardem's, and all the others, I believed the character. But in the end, the sheriff had no affect on the storyline at all.

And Woody Harrelson's character didn't add much. His purpose must have been to give Chigurh a reason to kill Stephen Root's character. Which makes you think, "so what?" We already knew this guy was nuts.

The time allotted to that (killing Harrelson and Root) could have been used to end the movie.

When the credits started scrolling, I said "what???". It just left ya hanging.

After a few moments, I lamely justified it in my mind by speculating that there must be a part 2, a sequel, where Sheriff Wells brings a fitting end to the movie.
