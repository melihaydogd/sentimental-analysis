Deceptively Good Bad Film
The thing about Oblivion is that it comes 80% of being a decent movie and ruins it in its last 20%.Now don't get me wrong the film is entertaining. It had almost no boring moments and the action was top notch as usual from a Tom Cruise movie. The narrative at least in the beginning was also enough to drive the story and keep the viewer glued to the screen. However, in the last 20% of the film where they had a chance to accelerate the plot and make it into a very good film falls back on itself by creating more loopholes with very lazy dialogue.I had low expectations of Oblivion due to having read the mediocre reviews online but surprisingly found it better than expected. I would write off movies like this as just as an entertaining action flick but Oblivion takes itself so seriously that I have to wonder what it could have been if they put a little more effort near the ending.
