Movie sucks big time,
This movie is for sure inspired by the 1984 George Orwell book and Zorro. But it is neither a political thriller, nor and action movie. It is just a waste of time. It could be a great action movie, but they wasted too much time being a "documentary", who cares? People kept talking and talking and talking about bullshit I have seen thousands of times before. They should have concentrated on the action and less on these speeches. This Talkathon would have been a great movie, were it not so preachy. How about the main character? Where did he get all his shakespearean knowledge? They never explain. Stupid movies always try to throw Shakespeare at you, thinking that maybe that will save it. Why would a zoro-like figure keep spouting these endless diatribes? This movie wants to be this and that and it ends up just sucking big time.
