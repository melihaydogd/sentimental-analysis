An overall excellent action packed movie
I read the reviews for this movie before I watched it, and even though most of the reviews that I read said that this was a bad movie because it was over the top and had cut-out stereotypical characters, I still thought it was a great action packed movie and was on par with The Die Hard series or even The Expendables. To say that this was a bad movie because it's unrealistic is to say that the action genre as a whole is terrible because most action movies are unrealistic, but they're still fun to watch. For the people that gave this movie a bad rating, you may as well give movies like G.I. Joe, X-Men, and Transformers bad ratings as well. That's just my opinion, and I welcome yours. If you're looking for a good time and enjoy action, spend the $1.50 and get this at Red Box. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
