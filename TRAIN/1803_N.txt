Not a kind of film you should "want" to watch.
Room -<br/><br/>A gross irresponsibility of the writer of this film, along with a supporting production crew, and cast. The story glamorizes the process of being held hostage, using a young women and her child. I am afraid why a story teller would choose such a topic, and why would he be so consumed as to make a message of this to the general population. Although it may seem cute at first seeing how a boy senses the room, and world around him; I am left with the taste that it only desensitizes others. This is not a story we should expose ourselves to like this, as a human race we might be tempted to play it down if it happens to others in real life, or make it seem to others it is not so bad to commit such an act to others.<br/><br/>There is a responsibility here when you interact with the public. I realize art is based on trying to work through what happens to you or what you have experienced, the art part being you are trying to get others to feel and communicate with you and what you are experiencing. But if that be the case here, then a more appropriate form of art in the direction of it should have been a movie portraying the horror of being held captive, and better yet maybe even realize this is too hard a topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the general public to consume. <br/><br/>I give this film a rating of zero, and suggest this film maker and crew take a different occupation to make money. I don&#39;t want to be a part of any of it anymore. And yes, there are many movies which could be labeled as I did with this one, but someone should write an honest review, a responsible review.
