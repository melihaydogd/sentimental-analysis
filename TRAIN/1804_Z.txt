Good story, but a clunky adaptation
About midway through this the movie Silent Hill came to mind. Not in relation to the story, but in the execution. Silent Hill was adapted from an incredibly scary videogame. They essentially took all the spooky bits and mashed them together on screen. I kept feeling like this looked better on paper. Sure enough in the credits its mentioned this is based on a novel of the same name by Daniel Kehlmann.

Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried play a married couple who, along with their daughter, take a vacation to a remote mansion in wales only to find there's something wrong and spooky about the house.

Off the bat Amanda and Kevin have zero chemistry. They just aren't believable as a couple and it doesn't help that shes clearly young enough to be his daughter, grand daughter even. They try to play to it, but theres just no warmth between them so it just comes off as fake and cringy.

Everything else in the film is equally clunky. His interactions with the townfolk are silly and kill the immersion. A bizarre and pointless casting choice for the "villain" is so ridiculous some audiences will laugh unintentionally.

The spooky bits are neat but not frightening. Its all just too goofy.

Its a shame because now I just want to go read the book and forget I watched this. Pretty disappointing especially considering this was written and directed by the "Stir of Echoes" guy. Actually if youre still reading this. go watch that instead. Much better film all around.
