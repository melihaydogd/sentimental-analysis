There is more than one side to the story
I will not repeat the other very favorable comments (with which I agree) listed for this movie.  However, I have one observation that I believe makes it even a more interesting movie.  Kubrick is such a genius that he realized that there had to be a gray area.  The soldiers may have been guilty of the crimes they were accused of when they did not reattempt to take anthill. By at least allowing this interpretation, it makes the movie more than just a preachy sermon against war.  It makes a movie a metaphor for other moral decisions.
