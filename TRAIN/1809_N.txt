Killed the legend of Queen
I grew up with Queen and am a huge fan. This movie was an insult to the entire band. Irritating and disappointing to watch. The story line concentrated on Freddy and the directing was really really bad. The acting wasn't anything to write home about either. I spent 2 hours waiting for the movie to hit the mark and it never did. Such a tragedy of what could have been a brilliant movie about a brilliant band. A complete waste of time and money.
