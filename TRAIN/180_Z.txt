Charlie Chaplin meets Lucy meets Jules
The 21st century has seen more superhero movies than I can count. This year alone has already seen "Black Panther". I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. "The Avengers" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.

It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in "An American Werewolf in London"). I'd like to see a crossover between this movie and John Landis's horror movie.

Anyway, it's not the ultimate masterpiece, but undeniably fun.
