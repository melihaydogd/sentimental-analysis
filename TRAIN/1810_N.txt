Extremely disappointing; another "girl power" movie
If you want to watch a "female-empowerment" take on a horror movie, then watch this. Or if you want a PG-13 horror movie disguised as an R-rated movie, watch this. Everything about this movie was disappointing. The only upside to this film was the unique camera angles seen throughout the movie (mostly the beginning). And even then, the unique angles had bad visual quality. This movie is all about some girl who decides to be a hero and stands up to the attacker. It was heavy-handed and very bad. Overall, this is a bad movie that should have been PG-13. No blood or actual terror or anything. NOT A HORROR MOVIE.
