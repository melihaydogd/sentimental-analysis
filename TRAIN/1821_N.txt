Why don't they make something different ? Always the same old.
***************************** SPOILERS********************************* Instead of writing a boring review about this adrenaline filled , fast paced,at times headache inducing movie i'd just write a list of clich√©s it contains :-1.Like every movie nowadays that promises action ,f6 has no 'well thought plot'. The mindless plot is there just to get to the car sequences and over the top special effects and stunts.2.There are too many characters that we don't care about. Most of them, like the two black guys are there purely for the one liners although they do work sometimes.3.A previously 'dead' character is actually ALIVE. OMFG i could never have thought of that. And his/her entire life memory is wiped. CLEVER!!4.One of the guys has a wife and a kid and you could tell from the beginning that one of them will later on be kidnapped just to throw on us one more nauseous chase sequence.5.One cop actually turns out to be a bad guy. How do they come up with this stuff!! 6.At one stage the cop hobbs (johnson) could shoot antagonist (luke evans) right in the face and spare us an hour or so but doesn't. "See you at the chase while you'll be pancaking civilians with your stolen tank and firing a few regular missiles".7.In the end everything turns out right.I mean cmon thats genius. None of the 'important good guys' lose anything and get their records cleaned. Although the Asian guy loses his girlfriend because she is killed horribly but that does not stop everyone from enjoying beer and steaks in the end.8.Dont even get me started on the runway.However there was good stuff too.1.Sceneries 2.Cars Anyways, There is a final scene when a 'new bad guy' makes an appearance. Oh yes we're not yet done with this franchise. However that appearance was stunning!To conclude, only watch if you are a fan of this franchise and love brainless, plot less action.1/10
