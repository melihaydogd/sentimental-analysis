Amazingly Bad. Rubbish. Awful. Unrealistic.
It honestly makes me sad that we live in an era where a poorly written screenplay like this gets such high praise. I don't even know where to begin to express how bad this film was. I wanted to walk out with 30 minutes left and I never do that. Just when you think the pain is going to end and the movie is over, there is an additional 4th act to add to the absurdity!

The lead does a decent job acting in this film but hard to not get a bunch of filth on you in the process.

Honestly, do we live in an era where people have stopped thinking and just want to go to a film and zone out and not require it to be good anymore or have a good story?

Stay away from this trash.
