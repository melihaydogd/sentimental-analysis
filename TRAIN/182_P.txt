Tough, Solid Crime Story
I think I saw the 1994 re-make before I ever checked this movie out. The re- make being so sexual and violent I expected less of that stuff in here because it was made 20-some years earlier. Well, there was less sex but I think the violence might even have been heavier in this movie. This was a pretty rough film and it's interesting to note the "PG." Today, this would be rated at minimum PG-13.Also, a contrast between the two films, language-wise: back then you'd hear a lot more usage of the Lord's name in vain; nowadays, the f-word is more popular. Good guy Steve McQueen in here never utters a bad word and is still a tough, no- nonsense kind of guy. The rest of the characters are the same. There are no "talk before I shoot" hokey scenes or people missing from point-blank range.McQueen is great, as he usually was, and the rest of the cast is pretty interesting, too, from sleazy Sally Struthers (pre-"All In The Family") to Love Story's Ali McGraw to old-timers Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens. Al Letterei was also good in here. His name isn't familiar to me, but his face was.With either this or the re-make, you get a solid crime-action story with "The Getaway."
