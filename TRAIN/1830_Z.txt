Alright, alright, alright.
Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, a true story about a man who contracted AIDs and finds a way to use this horrible situation as a way to benefit others, he finds a way to get certain treatment to people who have no access to hospital and other beneficial resources by creating the Dallas Buyers Club, where people pay for membership to this club where he gives the drugs for free.

What I liked: The performances are the best part of tis film for me. Matthew McConaughey plays our main character, a bigoted red neck whose journey isnt just about going against the FDA and big pharmacies, but its also a journey for self growth, how he becomes friends with people he would normally hate. This is the best performance Ive seen of McConaughey, its so realistic and solid. Jared Leto brings an incredible poignant performance as transsexual Rayon, very impressive to bring out that terrific performance. Special shout out to Jennifer Garner (remember her and McConaughney in The Ghost of Girlfriends Past lol) The other cast were great some didnt have much to do as the focus was on these two and they carried the film.

What i disliked: Some inconsistencies in tone and pace, and maybe a bit too long. The story wasnt as captivating as much as I thought the performances were. I still had a good time watching it and felt bad for the characters.

A good film, where the performances elevated it to another level.
