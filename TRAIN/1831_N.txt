Bullshite movie...
A movie about an old lady kidnapping small kids and giving them drugs with a needle... Wow!!! and a parent losing it and torturing a guy with a deformed face in an abandoned property of his, which he cannot repair due to economic problems. I think that movie adds to the mission of cinema and cinematography in general. No wonder why there are so many weirdos overseas... And I have to write ten lines the least for my movie review to b posted. So I'll start say awful things about this movie... Don't even try to press play on this movie it doesn't worth it. The Spiderman guy tries to act as a detective and the Wolverine guy tries to act as a family guy. The first has a tick and I believe that's why this movie is having an 8.1 average in IMDb and the latter has a problem with alcohol and he can't be convincing for even a second. Ahhh my ten lines (or more) are complete. Go Away from this so called movie. GO AWAY!!!
