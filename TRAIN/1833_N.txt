V for Very Crappy
The excessive dialogue, and numerous discussions of what happened in the past what will/may happen in the future make this movie move at a snails pace. Even when they do finally cut to flashbacks/forwards, they are slowed down by the voice over. The very first scene should be an indicator that the movie is going to move too slowly, filled with long alliterated dialogue, which is supposed to be comical but just ends up being annoying. The entire movie tries to pound it's message into people's minds, "People shouldn't fear their governments; governments should fear their people," but the message is overdone. It feels force-fed and doesn't have any subtlety to it. In the movie they talk about how writers use lies to tell the truth. Writers also use fiction to bring about philosophy, hiding it like candy coating. This movie was all sophism, one big rant without enough story wrapping it up into a swallowable package. Don't get me wrong, the message is a good one, and I really wish the movie could have delivered it in a blockbuster fashion, but they didn't. And when a message is delivered poorly, sometimes it would have been better if it weren't delivered at all.
