Oh my gosh, it's.....trash.
Well I rented this for one sole reason, just to complain about it. Well there's not much to complain about, except it was rather pointless. Here's a short review. I hope my politically correct terms do not offend any one, I have to put this disclaimer because the internet is full of oversensitive people. May contain an obvious spoiler, beware.

From the cover, I thought it would be another mindless lesbian flick just like room in Rome, my god did that movie suck. Unlike that film, this has characters and a generic love story, and of course, it's not porn. So it is an actual film, which surprised me, but it still was just meh. Now, I notice lesbians are always portrayed as beautiful women, never you know, a regular human being. Judging by how many of these films there are, my conclusion is that these films are not made for the sake of film making, but instead to satisfy peoples cravings. How many movies are about homosexuals, I can't even think of one. No, it's always women, maybe because men will want to watch it, and there for increase profits. Sex always sells, unfortunately talent rarely does.

Anyway, back to the film. It's just a generic love story about forbidden love, but then there is a happy ending. Blah, blah, blah, the film is pointless. I never believed the characters, especially during the first love scene, they over acted a bit too much, like the scene from Watchmen. And the tear running down her face, come on what a bunch of cheese. The whole film is just bland and boring. The environments are depressing, it's just so awful.

I know no one will take my advice, but stay away.
