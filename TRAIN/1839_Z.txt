Where is the dig?
"The dig" or "I don't know what this movie is about"? The dig itself and Ralph Fiennes just desappear in the middle of the WWII, personal non-related dramas and a "where did it come from" romance. All I know about digging now is that you should not be stuck in a really bad marriage.
