Worth watching
The film is about a cop named Nishi that has had a lot of bad things happen lately and is down on his luck. His wife has terminal cancer and when lashing out one of his fellow cops gets killed and one gets paralyzed. When he's off the force he decides to rob a bank, pay off his loan sharks, and go on trips with his wife until she dies. The loan sharks keep bothering him after he pays them off so he has to respond with violence throughout. It's a better idea for a movie than an actual movie in my opinion. I think a lot of it may be translation issues or cultural differences. Many times throughout the film they say things too exact and it doesn't feel like actual people would talk like that. Like "I'm a cop and you are Yakuza so we are enemies!". That's not an actual quote but that's the right idea.
