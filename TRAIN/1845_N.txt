A waste of money
When I watched the trailer I thought it was crap but then I thought, maybe I should it give it a shot. I love Xmen and can't wait until May to see it so maybe a little bit of mutant is not a bad idea on a Saturday night. It turned out really bad.

If Xmen is the real project, this is where the interns practice and get their coffee money. I was shocked that Marvel franchised this movie. There is no story line, no twist, no surprise, no thinking, nothing. And the casting is lousy as well, characters are dull and they try too hard to be funny. 

Yes, speaking of funny, I don't get why people think this movie is funny. My conversation with a Starbucks worker over the counter has more funny lines than this movie. Or the audience these days don't even read, that they still laugh at the jokes we laughed at in the 90s? 

If you wanna laugh during this movie, better a joint when the trailers are playing.
