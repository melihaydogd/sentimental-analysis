total confusion

Many people seem to consider this to be a brilliant film. Not me. It was a confusing barrage of flash backs, flash forwards, flash whatevers... There were few times when I thought I was beginning to get the drift of what was going on, but that's not how I felt by the end of the film. I believe that the intention of this film is just to mess with your mind, and that was not the sort entertainment that I was looking for when I watched it. Perhaps, at the end of the movie, they hoped I could have empathy with what it must be like to suffer from the memory condition that this guy has, so they tried to create an environment where my brain is turning itself inside out while trying to understand what's going on. Perhaps they succeeded, but I didn't like it and don't recommend it.So boring it annoyed me
