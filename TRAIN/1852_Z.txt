OK but it went overboard
If I was Ben Affleck and handed this script for the movie, I'd take it as it sounds like a good plot, however I'd refuse the part to play an Autistic person whose got super-human powers, an ace sniper shot, excellent heavy machine gun skills and a maths whiz because that's just gone over-board. They've practically made Ben Afflek untouchable, even worse than Jack Reacher because at least Jack Reacher gets a few hits to the face. This accountant has become something like the Equaliser, just out for revenge that can single-handedly take out a mafia. Why have the Directors not got any realism anymore in their scripts? I know this isn't a non-fiction movie but its becomes unbearable
