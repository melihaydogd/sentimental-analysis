different
(Being on the basis of my understanding that this is based on the columbine "events") this is one of those "touchy" subjects, I would imagine there is some sort of debate on whether or not something like this should be made. I believe everyone has a right to do what they want with art, to a degree, my only issue with the movie it that it could be viewed for the wrong reasons, But it also may answer some questions for people interested in these kind of situations, and the moments leading up to them. I guess it's no differen't than an episode of "american justice" as far as getting into the minds of the troubled. But for what it's worth as a film, it did it's job of portraying the moment leading up to something so tragic
