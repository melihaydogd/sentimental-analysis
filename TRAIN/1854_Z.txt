Distinctly Average
I think that V for Vendetta is over rated I think if it was done by anyone other than the wachowski brothers it wouldn't have even made it to cinema.....The storyline is good its an idea that hasn't been touched on but the execution is what let it down. Agent Smith plays a good part in this film as "V" but I don't think is supported by his fellow actors, Natalie Portman should be shot for her "English Accent" as most of the time I thought she was either from South Africa or France.... y wasn't keira Knightley used for this part she is exactly the same just English. The film also hung on way "V" wanted to get back at the Government they could of explained the whole story in one line... instead we were subjected to lots of boring scenes which led nowhere but to the point we had already heard over and over again.... I think Stephen Fry played a very good part and his acting saved the film slightly....Overall I gave this film 5/10 for the boredom I was forced to sit through
