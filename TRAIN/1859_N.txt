Lives up to the title; hilariously horrible beyond belief.
Well, some like it, some don't. The reason as far as I can tell is that it is simply such an incredibly, unbelievably horrible movie that it defies expectation or even imagination, to the point of being amusing in a way. If you think you can conceive of how bad this movie is, you are mistaken. You can't. But, there is a PLUS SIDE to that. At first I was in shock from the incredibly cheesy special effects, insanely, mind-twistingly awful plot, and the worst acting I have EVER SEEN, but then I realized that I was having the time of my life, because listening to the dialogue, I found myself laughing out loud. I missed some parts of the movie just because I was laughing so hard at the absurdity that someone actually made this film that I nearly wet myself. But there is no downside to missing a few minutes of this flick. Anyway I really think the film must be a joke, a parody of B-movies. And as a parody, it is very good. In summary, I recommend it.
