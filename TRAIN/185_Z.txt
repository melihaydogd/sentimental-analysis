I did not like this movie, am I a gay iraqi communist?
Whoa, I have just read some of the other reviews and it seems that if you dont like this film you must be anti-american.Now dont get me wrong, the opening scene was brilliant but to me it quickly settled into being just another war movie albeit a well produced and shot war movie. You know, the good ol' USofA rising up above  insurmountable odds to save the day blah blah blah.I just could not accept the basic premise of the film that several men's lives were to be put at risk for the reasons given, I mean war is war, stuff like that happens.Having said that I could accept this scenario happening today, (re Jessica Ryan) with all the ensuing publicity.I think part of the problem was my expectation. I was expecting a real anti-war film, one that leaves you thinking, you know, that war is bad. This was just another good guys (America), bad guys (Germans) type film.If you want to see a real, and I mean real anti-war film you must see the 1930 version of "All quiet on the Western front". Ask me the ending of Private Ryan and in three months I wont be able to tell you, but our High School teacher made us sit through this when I was about 13/14 and to this day the final scene still jars me.Go see it, trust me, it will move you more than Ryan. (look it up on imdb it has scored 8.2 to ryans 8.3)But whats the use, people who gave Private Ryan a 10 will probably be bored with it because it is one war film that has little violence in it (and it is full of "shudder" Germans).
