Popcorn flick containing John Wick DNA
If you want to indulge in some mindless, forgettable action - then this movie's just for you!

From the opening scene, we are invited into the familiar world of the John Wick franchise. We see our protagonist living a mundane life, which has us impatiently anticipate the adversarial forces cross his path. Except we are given nothing but tongue-in-cheek layers of his past and tasteless action sequences. The degree of violence and brutality was satisfyingly ephemeral as there was nothing remotely novel. Our antagonists are unnaturally revealed using the same Russian Mobster tropes we've grown tired of since 2014.

Film felt too much of a carbon copy; the settings and places of the action scenes are clear rehashes of John Wick and The Equalizer; and the film's score is a shoddy take at Tyler Bates' adrenaline-laced tactical music.

I've already forgot about the movie. 5/10 is what I'll remember.
