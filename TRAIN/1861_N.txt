No Zombies, No High
I can live with the fact that this isn't actually a zombie movie, the bigger problem is it's barely even a horror movie. You have to sit through 45 minutes of a boring 'teen' drama, with some of the worst dialogue ever put to film, before anything even remotely 'horrific' happens.Just because Virginia Madsen is the movie doesn't mean it's any good
