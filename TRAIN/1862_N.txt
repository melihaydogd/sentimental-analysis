Meet Okja meat
The South Korean project, which didn't even get a tenth of it's budget at the box office, turned out to be one of the most disgusting films I've seen. For me personally, it was unpleasant to see how creators with such a zealous obsession are trying to promote vegetarianism, as almost the only way of worldview. For them, maybe yes. But for millions of people subject to religious requirements not to eat the meat of certain animals, this is just a ban. Of course, many of you can prove and explain to me that all this is shown with good intentions, but I see this as just another division, headed not by religion, but simply by food.
