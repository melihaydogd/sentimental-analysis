Best action movie ever
This movie is the best action movie I have ever seen, or probably will see. It's got great music, made by Hans Zimmer, Harry-Gregson Williams and Nick Glennie-Smith. This is THE action-score in my book! Great performances, good writing, character development, humor, and one of the best car chases ever. Great cinematography, great editing, great sound, the list goes on! Buy the Criterion Edition-DVD of this movie NOW! 10/10
