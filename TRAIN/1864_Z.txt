Good until it tries to become an action movie
The movie starts out as a promising Sherlock Holmes-ish adventure. Murders, suspects, clues no one would think of, etc. But then...oh, but then. About halfway through the movie, the movie veers on the course of action. A temple collapses, a swordesque fight on ice...it's just not Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle always has a more mystique over the crimes, and it rarely turns into a fast paced, adrenaline pumping adventure. The hallucinations, while interesting, are also farfetched, such as Watsons hallucination in the graveyard.
Though, if you make it through the credits, and know about Holmes' arch enemy, you will be pleasantly surprised.
Many Holmes sayings and trademarks appear ('The game is afoot', The hat and pipe) and for a fan of the books, those will also be appreciated.
It could have been so much better, but alas, it was not. 5/10
