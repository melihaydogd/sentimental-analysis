Why Spend Time and Money in This Awful Remake?
In 1993, the alcoholic Joseph "Joe" Doucett (Josh Brolin) is a loathed man with basically one only friend, Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who owns a bar. Joe neglects his three year-old daughter Mia and is estranged of his ex-wife Donna. Out of the blue, Joe is kidnapped and locked alone in a room for twenty years. Along the years, he learns that Donna was brutally murdered and he was accused of the crime and Mia was adopted and raised by a family. Unexpectedly he is released without knowing who arrested him and why. He meets the humanitarian social assistant Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) and his old friend Chucky and together they try to find the identity of his kidnapper."Oldboy" is a poor remake directed by Spike Lee of the South Korean masterpiece. It is sad to see Spike Lee so decadent wasting his talent in a garbage like that. I was reluctant to see this remake and unfortunately I spent my Friday night watching this crap instead of watching the South Korean movie again. Spike Lee should do the same. My vote is three.Title (Brazil) : "Oldboy: Dias de Vingan√ßa" ("Oldboy: Days of Revenge")
