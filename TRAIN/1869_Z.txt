Fool Me Once
I'm a regular guy. I like sports, beer, cars, scantily-clad women and action films. I'm young enough now to take all of these things very seriously, and old enough to know how silly that is. Nonetheless, it really steams my dumplings when I exchange any of my hard-earned money in an effort to attain of a few brief moments of preferably mindless entertainment and I'm left feeling hoodwinked. That being said, The Wachowski's V For Vendetta SEEMED, based on its thrilling trailer, like the perfect vehicle for an action film fan to enjoy another edgy and fantastically rendered foray into the world of graphic novels. With (in the trailer) all those sexy shots of slashing silver blades, mingled with just the right amount of futuristic ambiance, gun play, pyrotechnics and mysteriously masked villainy, what action film enthusiast wouldn't run to his computer and buy his tickets in advance? You... you can be the one.
