emotional strangulation
It's an "emotional manipulation for dummies" type of film, with boring direction and cardboard characters. Nice performances by the actors though, some great moments, but nothing outside the "Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison" feel of the entire movie.I saw it one and a half times, and would see it again only if I got paid for the trouble.Similarly, I hated 'The Green Mile", only later did I find out it's the work of Darabont.My recommendation: Skip this, and go see OZ again.
