Relatively good slasher film
I found this little slasher film to be better than many of its early 80s counterparts, mainly because there is more character development here than is customary for this genre. The director shows an almost humanistic touch in the dialogue scenes, and the two basic characters are very likable. On the other hand, hardcore horror fans are likely to be disappointed with this, because as a straight "slasher" it's a watered-down, virtually goreless piece of filmmaking! In any case, check it out. (**)
