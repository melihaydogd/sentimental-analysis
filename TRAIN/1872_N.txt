Piece of trash
The movie was a piece of trash and a garbage of a movie.The Karishma and Akshay pair attracted me to this litter.Story is nothing new here.Just a regular old love triangle.Acting is average from all except from Kapoor.She has done a good job.But as a fan of Karishma.I request others to avoid this trash at all costs.Abhisek Bachan is average.Akshay is passable but was good in the climax scene.Personally i don't like Dharmesh Darshans movie.I liked Raja Hinduatani.Dhadkan was average but it had good performances and songs.This and Bewafaa were terribly made movies.Script and dialogs are weak.Karishmas character has a hang over from Sridevis in Chandni,Abhi also has a Rishi Kapoor hang over from Chandni,Akshays role remind us of Anils and Vinod Khannas in Chandni and Taal.The script has too many loop holes.The biggest draw back was Abhi Karishma pairing who were dating at that time.Sadlly there is no chemistry.Locations are too common.Songs are forgettable.With the exception pf Zindagi Ko Bina Pyar the songs are boring and fails to linger in your memory.Avod this at all costs.If you are a fan of Karishma i am not forcing you to avoid it or watch it
