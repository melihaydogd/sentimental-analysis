No script, no movie...

First of all I must say that I've had the pleasure to see the first 3 "Mad Max" movies. I know that this "Mad Max - Fury Road" was not meant to be neither a prequel nor a sequel of the original ones, so I write this review with that in mind. Summarizing my opinion, this movie was dreadful. So bad, that I couldn't believe it was the same movie that got me so psyched when I saw the trailer last year. It's a non stop of crazy cars, explosions and cgi supported stunts that will definitely please those that like cars and action movies, but whose plot makes no sense at all. Now I could be here telling you about the visions that Max has from beginning until the end, which lacks explaining, or about the fact that they begin a journey from A to B just to find out they must return to A, but if they had stayed there all along the movie would be 7 minutes long, or even to the fact that they meet a bunch of women that live in the middle of nowhere, but surprisingly one of them was waiting barenaked on top of an electric pole, waiting for whoever would ever turn there, if it took 5 minutes or 200 years!... Instead I'll only complaint that apart from the fast driving and explosion filled footage, this has no story at all. The quest begins with a purpose, but that purpose is faulty and Max's character is relutant to join any group but quickly changes his mind... he's rogue, but he's nice... Furiosa is a powerful woman but is eager to accept that man she knows nothing of, to join their getaway posse... It's all so senseless that almost made me cry! Build some hot rods, add some blasts, create some funky looking characters and forget any story, because we have a movie! Oh, and could someone tell me what the f... are some guys doing playing drums and a guitar that shoots fire in the middle of a high speed pursuit? I mean, I know it's badass, but come on.....
