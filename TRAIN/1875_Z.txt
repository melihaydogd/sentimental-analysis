Inappropriate for kids in my opinion
Technology is a wonderful thing. However, maybe we need to spend a little more time contemplating the subject matter of our "cartoons" rather than how cool we can make them look. To begin a child's movie with the revelation that death and heartbreak are inevitable is just plain stupid. This movie is a depressing look at real life that is, in my opinion, completely inappropriate for a child. I thought that, given time, the movie would accelerate to a more upbeat theme. No such luck. Throughout, you're reminded that this poor old man is alone. Old and alone are just not entertaining subjects, even if they're wrapped in bright colors.
