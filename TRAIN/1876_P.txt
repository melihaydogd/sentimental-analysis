Great feel good film
Very beautiful film with a strong topic. Definitely not a kids movie, but with important topics that should be thought provoking for everybody. I am sure after this film a lot of people become vegetarians. I was close. ;-) The film really is able to touch the right spots with the audiences. Its a beautiful story about the friendship of a little girl and her (extraordinary) animal as well as a film about how greedy industrials can rape our nature. This mix up is wonderfully done by Joon- ho Bong. The acting was good. I was especially impressed by Bong's leading girl Seo-Hyun Ahn who was really capturing her characters brilliantly and I hardly ever saw a performer interact with so much feeling with an animated character. Excellent job. Jake Gyllenhaal was a bit too eccentric for my taste but he has one or two funny moments. Tilda Swinton was also fine in her double role but also a bit too exaggerated at some points but I guess that is just Bong's style. Paul Dano was really good. One of his better performances lately and it was nice to see Lily Collins. The film is a good follow up to "Snowpierecer" and a very original story with original characters and settings.
