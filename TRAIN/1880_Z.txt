Watchable, standard fare.
The Informer is well acted and executed fine, it's just not quite gripping or memorable.

With Joel Kinnaman, Ana de Armas, Rosamund Pike and Clive Owen, who could say no? Problem is, the film's quite generic and tame for something like this. Also why have Common play a main character, with this cast at your disposal. There's little resolution and Owen's character getting tricked at the end, pretty weak.
