And then I watched a movie from Hollywood...
That Suzy Creamcheese, who was featured on the first four Mothers' albums is referred to as Frank Zappa's roomate in this documentary is ignorant and inexcusable.
I love Ruth but her anemic piano drum duet of the "Black Page" would never have been released by Frank Zappa. And the Kronos Quartet, why are they even included in this?
If I did not know anything about Frank Zappa before I would have been baffled by this film but I did enjoy seeing the greeting cards Frank Zappa designed and also his home movies and the "World's Greatest Sinner" related footage.
