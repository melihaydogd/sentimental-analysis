Excellent action movie - but Statham is overshadowed by his co-stars
Good quality action film with Jason Statham in the lead. With Clive Owen and Robert DeNiro costarring, we're talking of a stellar cast.

Danny Bryce (Statham) and Hunter (DeNiro) are high profile assassins for hire. Danny is said to be the best in the business, but retires to Australia for a quieter life. However, Hunter fails to deliver on an assignment he took up with a deposed ruler in exile in Oman. Danny takes up the assignment to save Hunter.

The assignment is to get revenge for the ex-king's sons, who were killed by SAS agents - Highly trained forces in the British Army - during war time. Danny is to get a video recording of confessions by the former SAS agents and then to kill them in a way that labels the deaths as accidents.

This is an extremely difficult task, and how Danny goes around planning this out is a major plus point for the film. This becomes more complicated with the introduction of the Feathermen - a secret society of former agents protecting each other. The head enforcer, Spike (Clive Owen) gets involved and starts tracking Danny and his team.

The movie goes through several twists and turns, and keeps a solid pace throughout. I love Jason Statham, and he played his part in his usual, stoic, businesslike way. But I wish he had brought in a bit more... well, something into this role. Detached and minimalistic is a good way to portray a professional assassin, yes. But somehow, it fails to deliver a human connection, and makes it harder to relate. This contrasts greatly with the warmth we see in DeNiro's character - despite having a far shorter role. Clive Owen also clearly outperforms the lead actor.

A very enjoyable, solid action movie. Allegedly based on true life events portrayed in the book
