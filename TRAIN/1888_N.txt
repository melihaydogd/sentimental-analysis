This is not Rambo..!!
I went to see Rambo last night and looking so much forward as I grow up watching Stallone and Rambo was the best. Firstly movie was short, no drama, very poor script no time spent on it, nothing original I be honest this isn&#39;t really a Rambo film. Plot done so many times similar to Taken. One point I was thinking this is more like Home Alone for the adults. Worst among all in the Rambo series...!!!
