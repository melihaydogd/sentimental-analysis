Very good and original!
Scarlett Johansson is a kind of alien cannibal, she approaches lonely men and takes them to a place known only to her and devours them until there is nothing left of the poor tempted men, which they thought they would have a terrible game of sex. Although, the same thing is repeated again and again, everything is captivating, not boring at all. High level direction, the story, the acting, the film absolutely is worth seeing.
