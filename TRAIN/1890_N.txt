NOT A FEEL GOOD FILM
This is one of the most overhyped pieces of garbage films I have ever seen. Jennifer Grey is an eyesore and has a poison personality pouring out of her. Swayze was far too old to be playing a heart throb. He did not look good for his age at all. And his character was not nice. Yes the dancing was good but that was all. How about making it into a musical instead of the absurd plot? The guy who plays babys father almost seems brain dead. The women playing babys sister was even uglier than Jennifer Grey. You will not feel happy after watching this embarrassment of a film
