Good on Drama But Poor on Action
This atypical movie would have been better titled, "Brothers" instead of "Arsenal" especially as this film isn't an action-thriller. Seeing this movie in the context of a psychological thriller and family drama might allow the audience to avoid the huge disappointment in terms of the expectation for a lot of action and violence even though there is at times plenty of blood splattered on the screen. John Cusack plays a backseat to Nicholas Cage whose presence is at times displayed in a cagey fashion while Cusack has a role similar to his more engaging one in the action thriller The Prince (2014). The pacing is strained as the focus of the movie is on the relational development of two brothers growing up and later how their relationship and trust is tested. The director does a commendable job in the depiction of a strikingly honest normal behavior of low-income, dysfunctional Americana. Yet at the same time he struggles in keeping the audience engaged ironically because of the realism of the normalcy of potentially warped lives (try watching home videos). There is a sudden twist which is also impression in terms of surprising the audience in how humanity is displayed and the attempt to humanizing many of the characters. But overall, the movie seems to lack the fine balance of the interesting rhythm of scenes stitched together and the questions raised as to how someone so conveniently can find someone who is missing and its inability to capture the intensity of many of the more high profile popular crime films such as John Wick (2014) or even Taken (2008).
