Decent film
From the opening moments of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama. The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it&#39;s characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession. Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it&#39;s movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal. Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang. The delight is in meeting these characters one by one. The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up. The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime. Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked. The director has included a number of very memorable scenes. This is not a linear film. The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing. This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate.
