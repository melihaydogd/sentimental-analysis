Very disappointing
I find it really hard to believe that the writers gave their best shot at this. The gags are predictable and boring slapstick, the story is extremely predictable. The only really funny scenes had already been killed by watching them 300 times in the trailer - which was extremely funny by the way. Well, I guess the movie just reflects where the series has gone for the last handful of seasons. Nowhere! There were way to few references to the most classic scenes from the show, and so many of the characters that makes the Simpsons so funny was also lacking. The Simpsons isn't just funny when Homer is in the picture hurting himself. The Simpsons best humor is the subtle political incorrect satire on the American way of living. That is all gone now. I really felt that they had tried to hard to make it an all family entertainment movie with no guts, political incorrectness, surprises or blood (Itchy and scratchy episode). The Simpsons has lost their nerve.
