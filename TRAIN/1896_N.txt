Fantasy Purporting to be Serious
Killers everywhere and the FBI not to be seen. Drugs everywhere and the DEA only mentioned in the background and never to be seen.

The local police say to the guy being chased to look after himself and let him go. Not a single policeman to "stake out" or "follow" the guy with the money. This is after the mass killing at the start of the movie and several more after this. Gee wiz the police must have more to do than worry about solving crime. What rubbish.

The worst plot aspect of this film is the guy who gets the money is portrayed as smart, a real outdoors man. Yet to get lost with the cash he stays in his home town, then moves to the local city and finally heads to the family home - and of course - oh so obvious - his mother in law tells the bad guys where he is going.

Surely a smart outdoors hunter would know that the best way to get lost fast would be to go to New York or Paris and then disappear.

Could go on for hours about the poor story line and plot faults, but you got to see this for yourself to realize it is typical Coen Brothers where reality is forgotten and fantasy ensues.
