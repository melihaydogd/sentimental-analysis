A great Family movie (for everyone in the family!)
I'm giving this a 9 instead of a 10 simply because I'm sensitive to "found footage" films with a bit of shaky camera. However "Cloverfield" it isn't. I was so pulled in by the relationships of the characters (a group of young friends) and their struggle (to remain close despite a construction project threatening to tear them apart with a forced move).

Yes, the themes are similar to E.T. - but updated for a new generations with lovely graphics and I think, a more hip and current take on the idea of acceptance and friendship. This is one of those rare films that both adults and children can take something from and the whole family will enjoy together. A real treat for me to take my 8-year-old to!
