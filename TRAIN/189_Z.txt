Nice Movie with a happy ending.
This movie touches on conversion therapy which has been proved to screw people up. It has some charm, and the acting is fine. It was a bit formulaic, with the gay son and his dad not getting along, been then again that is true with a lot of gay men, but of course not all. It would have been nice to see gay actors playing these parts, but I also realize they need some actors with some sort of a fan base so the movie gets seen. This film was not life changing, but is worth a look, and who does not like a hopeful, happy ending?
