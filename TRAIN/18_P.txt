powerful and stirring, a must-see educational material to promote awareness about the true origins of Latino communities in US
It is incredibly important that the new generations watch this documentary as it is inspirational and informative.

My personal reaction was of immense emotion: from the beginning till the end I could relate and fully understand the pain of the Latino immigrants, even though I come from Eastern Europe.

Hopefully enough progressive-minded educators expose the truth about the so-called "immigration problem" and fully utilize Juan Gonzales' book to further build lessons and courses on how and why "the most dangerous enemies are not each other, but the great wall of ignorance between us".

Thank you WENDY THOMPSON and EDUARDO LOPEZ for your courage and strength to produce this film despite all obstacles.
