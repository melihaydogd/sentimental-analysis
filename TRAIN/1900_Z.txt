Wow, that was terrible
I just got home from spending good money and time to watch this stinker. I truly don't understand any rating above a 6. I can handle no plot, but no character development or learning along the way or some revelation or commentary about life other than the moronic one at the end? Please don't waste my hopes for something good.

Also, as a man who works his tail off to support his family and allow his wife to stay home to raise kids that say "thank you" as opposed to the knuckleheads in the movie, I found it appalling that every significant man in the movie other than the photography teacher was an arrogant pontificating loser and half of them were abusive drinks. What was the point of this?

I wanted to throw up every moment Ethan Hawke was on screen. His meaning of life speech was pathetic and I can't understand the reason for putting it in the movie other than to re-enforce what self- aggrandizing asses men are. Why go through all the trouble to make this movie and sucker people in to watch a big "So What?" If you go to movies to be inspired, emotionally moved or presented with another viewpoint to ponder, you probably won't like this movie. Sorry, I just don't get this movie. I rated it a 6 because it is not terrible just really mediocre, including the acting. To bad the director was stuck with actors who got worse over years, not better.
