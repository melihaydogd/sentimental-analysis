Visual gem without much substance
I can imagine that back in the 80s this was mindblowingly good and the visuals hold up very well to this day, but story and character wise... For a movie that's relatively slow paced, there is hardly any character development, logical decisions or motivation (aside for revenge, survival and being forced back on duty) for most of the runtime. Characters make such rash decissions, it's almost laughable. All this sadly makes a decently build up universe, pretty boring.. The acting wasn't bad though. I'm giving this a 5 just for visuals and the fact that this probably has inspired quite a bit of (better) sci-fi today.
