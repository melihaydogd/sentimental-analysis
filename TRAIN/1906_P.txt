Analysis for Pulp Fiction (1994)
I actually like this film a little more than some other R-rated films, including "Do the Right Thing". There are more good scenes that I could watch than other R-rated films. However, like "Do the Right Thing", this doesn't touch my heart. One bad thing about this film is that there was a bit of violence that I really don't want to see. In terms of the other parts of this film, they are okay, like the fight scene, but they also have some drawbacks. In my opinion, the worst thing about this film is once again some partial nudity. I have never liked seeing some movies that include nudity, starting with "The Graduate". But not everything is bad. There are some good parts in this film, including great acting, nice cinematography, and very good lighting effects. The rest of the stuff in the film are like a hit and miss for me. Overall, this is a good film, but it doesn't offer as much comparing to the other films that I reviewed.
