Not as brilliant as the first one but just as entertaining!
Aliens (1986) was the follow up to the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is in trouble. Not only is the corporation's multi-million dollar spaceship is gone but so is the crew. To add to her worries, she's missed a lot of time during her last trip. With no one willing to listen to her ramblings and a whole lot of explaining to do, Ripley is stuck between a rock and a hard place. That is until the corporation gives her an offer she cannot refuse.

All though it's not as well directed or written as Alien (1979), the sequel Aliens is quite entertaining. This time Ripley get's some payback for all the grief those acid dripping insectoids brought down upon her in the past. This time around James Cameron takes over the directorial reins in this typical 80's gung-ho and pseudo-patriotic sci-fi/horror film. Despite all the macho posing and tough guy posturing, this one's worth a couple of replays. Several of the Cameron players appear in this one as well.
