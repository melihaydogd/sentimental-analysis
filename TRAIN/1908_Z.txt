"Mission Awful"
"Knight and Day" is about June Havens(Cameron Diaz) who finds her everyday life tangled with that of a secret agent,Roy Miller(Tom Cruise) who has realized he isn't supposed to survive his latest mission. As their campaign to stay alive stretches across the globe, they soon learn that all they can count on is each other.

Cast-wise, Good Looking. That's it. Just plain good looking. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz forms a good looking handsome cast and the good things ends there. Cameron Diaz is over-acting or supposed to be over acting, that ain't clear, but whatever it is, it's distasteful. Tom Cruise looks very good throughout the movie, even when he is fighting more than dozen bad guys or making his improbable escape through armed helicopters, SWATs, arms dealer etc. Peter Sarsgaard looks tired and out of sort is his role as Miller's friend turned foe.

"Knight and Day" strength lies in its cast. Good looking and very likable, but that alone does not compensate for their pathetic acting. Action scenes are good but too implausible and far fetched to entertain an iota of believability.

From someone who has "3:10 to Yuma", "Identity" & "Walk the Line" in his Directorial resume, much was anticipated from the movie. But it suffers from ridiculous plot, improbable action sequences, pathetic acting and stupid ending. I guess, it is safe to say that its a colossal failure from multiple aspects of the movie.

Overall, "Knight and Day" is not an entertaining nor a comedy nor an action nor a good movie. It fails in delivering a semblance of what we call as entertainment.
