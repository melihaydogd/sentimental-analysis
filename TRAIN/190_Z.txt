Don't Expect Too Much - It is a remake
It is rare for a remake of a really good movie ever lives up to the expectations. Any person watching this movie thinking it would be as good as Goldie and Kurt are badly disappointed - very badly. So, lower the expectations and watch it for what it is. It's a different take on on old story. Producers failed by trying too hard to replicate the magic of Goldie and Kurt. That could never happen in a million years or a million remakes. Reset the location to east coast, keep the inter cultural thing but make it a Carib drug runner. Then cast actors that can actually act.But there are still enough slapstick comedy to enjoy laughing.
