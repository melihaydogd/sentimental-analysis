Slow
This movie may be especially interesting to cinema students, as people say it's an historical point for film-noir and other such genres, besides all the new techniques applied, which were indeed well used..

But for a more general public, the pace of the movie is too slow. Like most "old" movies. Also, the story is quite simple, especially for today's standards, since we've already "seen it all".

However, the way it is presented works. Quite well, in fact. The only problem is that the story has so little to it, that it could've been presented easily in half the time, instead of boring the viewer with meaningless police investigations.. Until I got past half of the movie, I was considering giving up on it, but the last part hooked me up till the end. The way they present the moral dilemma behind the story really makes one think about it. But that's pretty much it.

Still, a pleasant experience, if the viewer is patient/doesn't have anything else to do..
