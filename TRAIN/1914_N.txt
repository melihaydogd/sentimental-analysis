Political Propaganda
This film is clearly political propaganda! I am not some political nut but I am also no idiot. When a film is made a certain bit of the creators beliefs are ingrained and that doesn't bother me, but that is not what happened here. A ruthless Christian conservative enslaved an entire country by making it a police state. He did it by creating fear through phony terrorist attacks. He outlawed the Koran. He locked up all the homosexuals. There were repeated references to AMERICAS WAR and how it destroyed them. This is nothing but outright left-wing propaganda and I would be just as outraged about a film that went the other way. I believe a film like this goes to far no matter whose politics it is pushing and quite frankly I am disgusted!
