Decent Suess story, but terrible by comparison
If this was intended to be a sequel to the famous Christmas tale, it was horribly written because it completely ignores the Christmas movie's conclusion. If it is a prequel, it's also terrible because Max's story doesn't fit. The only logical explanation is that this movie is an alternate dimension, completely unrelated to the most famous version of the Grinch.

At any rate, it's certainly has Suess' prose and drawings, though the animations are dated and the plot isn't very inspired. How the Grinch Stole Christmas is famous because of its message. The Grinch had a full character arc, emotional depth, and a truly diabolical plan. The Grinch in Halloween is Grinch Night lacks all of that. He is driven purely by an animalistic instinct that compels him to scare people without any intent to inflict lasting physical or emotional harm. It waters down his evil side and strips him of emotions.
