A Harrowing Film with Incredible Performances!
Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, &#39;Room&#39; is a challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the film&#39;s hefty nature.<br/><br/>&#39;Room&#39; Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.<br/><br/>&#39;Room&#39; is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good people. But its also about hope &amp; fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed &amp; often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son &amp; mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down.<br/><br/>&#39;Room&#39; is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful &amp; the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson&#39;s Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Brie Larson &amp; Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders &amp; makes &#39;Room&#39; unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen &amp; The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.<br/><br/>On the whole, &#39;Room&#39; is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its power is undeniable.
