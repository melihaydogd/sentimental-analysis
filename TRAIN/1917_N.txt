Incomprehensible dreck
One of the most boring films I've ever seen. Granted it has one of the most disturbing deaths I've ever seen in a movie, and an interesting mechanic for the alien to trap it's victims, it can't make up for the rest of the film. They may as well have called it 'Scarlet Johansson drives for two hours with no facial expression' and it would be an accurate film title. Backed out of it halfway. Don't bother.
