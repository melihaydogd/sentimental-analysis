Kevin has lost touch with reality
Ripping off James Bond in the intro foreshadows the current state of politics in Europe and the comics performance which is poor. How could this even make it to a theater? Do censors exist in Hollywood? If they do it might serve them and their wallet to make this an HBO special. Paying to watch it might make anyone feel like they gave Donald Trump money to make them laugh via stand up comedy. Everyone laughing in the audience made me loose hope in humanity. I hope that the next time Kevin will hire black people to write jokes or quit trying to write his own content because he sounds like an angry white man. Sometimes having too much money makes people less funny and this is that scenario.
