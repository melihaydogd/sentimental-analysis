A boring, uneventful nothingness
Pretty much all movies, which I ever liked, are highly rated on IMDb. Although not all highly rated movies on IMDb are movies which I like. And this is one of them.

The movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point. Cool. That's it. Nothing else.

It was a cliché scene after cliché scene for almost three hours. Three hours which I'll never get back :) I'd rate it with negative 3, but there's no rating lower than 1.

Sometimes, a movie starts bad. It goes on for a while, but then, at the end, something new and unique happens and you think: "Oh! I totally did not expect that. So it was worth seeing it". Well. Not now. Bad start, middle, and end. Oh, he met another girl. Really. They like each other? Is this how people who like each other act?

The acting was so poor and just about every line said, was said in so unnatural way. Real people in real situations, simply do not look like or act like that. I felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters. None of them seemed to have any social skills.

None of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives. They had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations. The plot for such conversations goes like: "blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blah".
