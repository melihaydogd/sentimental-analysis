Not worth any of the praise it receives
Terrible. Just terrible. There is so little, if anything good to say about this film. Poor acting, terrible script with childish attempts at wit, inconsistencies, complete lack of shock or confusion from any of the characters at seeing a man coming back from the dead. There's a reason Brandon Lee only did Martial Arts flicks before this, it's clearly all he was good at. Stephen Hawking could convey emotion and act more convincingly than this ham. Without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Don't get drawn into liking it just because it's a cult film and you think you'll seem cool if you do - watch it and judge it by its qualities rather than its style, and you'll see this film for the stinker it is.
