Only a visual show

A game cinematic or a visual show, but not a good movie, like a very long movie trailer with lots of explosions and action ... and then more explosions, fighting and action ... you can feel like watching somebody playing a 2 hour arcade video-game.

There's no Max anywhere, the plot and the story are too basic but, who needs more this days? It looks that you can't make a good movie that make people use their brains 1%.

Even classic action movies had twists and keep you interested in the story, but even a new Mad Max movie has to be so basic.

People is used to this kind of 'movies' and see them as normal, sadly. Go and watch a car crash show alive and you will have a better time.
