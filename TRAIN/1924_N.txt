Same old movie, temptations, struggles, success.
As a teenager, I had a choice to choose which movie to watch with my girlfriend the next morning. So I diligently went online to see the IMDb rankings for the two movies. Firstly Don't Mess With The Zohan and secondly Kung Fu Panda. Based on the ratings and reviews I chose to see kung Fun Panda, it seemed the better choice.... It seemed the keyword.

So when I eventually went to see it, you could say I was a little let down. Actually you could say an enormous amount. To make matters worse, I was surrounded by children, normally tolerant of them, today I was not. They laughed at inappropriate jokes, scenes which were clearly not even funny. I contemplated "when will this end?" "It must be shortly" This movie is clearly not as comical as Shrek or Ice Age, it did not have witty, enchanting characters. Since when does a goose or duck give birth to a panda? There should be more factual, intellectual movies for children to see in the holidays! The only good thing was the imagery and advancement in realistic cartoons. I was more than relieved when it ended, I WANT MY $10.80 BACK!
