This Movie is Completely....Overboard!
Having never seen the original (at the point of this writing), I really can't compare this to that movie, however having seen good movies, I can compare this to them. I've seen Anna Faris is decent comedies. ("The House Bunny" is one I like OK) I've come to enjoy Eugenio Derbez in a few movies that I've seen him in. (I liked "How to Be a Latin Lover") I didn't have high expectations for this movie, and even then, I didn't feel like it was that good. I may have laughed a few times, but this all feels like a reheated meal from a few days ago. It's not fresh, witty or that enjoyable. This is a film that I really can't recommend to anybody. Hard pass.
