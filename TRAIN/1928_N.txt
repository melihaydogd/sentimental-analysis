On the world's finest films
I would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the "Shawshank Redemption", that one take a considered look at the New York Times "Best 1000 Films Ever Made" list. Unfortunately, the guidelines of this site preclude me,oh gentle reader, from giving you the URL. One should be able to Google it, so all is not lost.The NYT was good enough to excerpt the list from Peter Nichols' The "New York Times Guide to the 1,000 Best Films Ever Made".What ? The "Shawshank Redemption" is not on this list, you say ?Perhaps, humble viewer, you haven't seen enough films of the first rank. But, have no fear, this is a remediable condition. But, be a dear and do try to see some of the movies on the list,please, before voting on this site. I really hate to see so many people make the mistake of voting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of IMDb's very interesting site. It's ever so declasse.Remember, an educated public is an informed public. Now, do your part.
