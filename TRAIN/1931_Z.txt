OK action movie, but the characters are not cast correctly. I know they needed big names to make this movie fly, because the script is suckage. The original story is better, they should have stuck to the original story.

Far too many cut scenes, shadow warriors and blurry transitions, to make the fight scenes seem like action, but in reality they are only sleight of hand BS and short cuts to making the movie move forward. They also use a ton of deus ex machina.

I didn't really care for the movie. It's terrible, but for an action movie it barely passes. At the end, it shows a nod to the old show, but the entire script was an excuse to make a terrible movie. There was no "if you have a problem maybe you could hire the A-Team".
