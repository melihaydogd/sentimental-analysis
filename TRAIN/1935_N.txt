Unsure where to begin...
Oh deary, deary me, Benjamin. I opted to watch this during a rare evening of no work. What a massive mistake! This was awful on so many levels. Basically just avoid it - in the same way the actors avoided any effort and the director avoided any attempt at a descent composition. Trust me. Have never reviewed a film before, but felt compelled to after this offensive excuse at film-making.
