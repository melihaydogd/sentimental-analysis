B Movie - Triple A
This movie is not for everyone i gotta say. But for a B movie it is on the top of it's game. The corny characters,Catchphrases and bad effects are great in my point of view. If you are going in with the idea of watching a 'good' movie you're wrong. The first scene already tells you what kind of film you're watching and when you are spoiled with Hollywood blockbusters and aren't familiar with this style of movie i agree you wouldn't like it. But if you can look past the special effects etcetera and appreciate the film for what it really is your gonna have a blast.(you gotta be at least 18 to get the greatness of it).Signed, A Critic of Life
