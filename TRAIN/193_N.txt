Not a love story, a betrayal is the operative word. "I'm Sorry" No she wasn't
I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I have to agree with one of the other members, "...as bad as a movie can be...", exactly. The acting was sub-par and the dialogue, which very little existed, was mostly monotone and single word phrases. I am not going to get into the political aspects of the movie or who was right and who was wrong in the Bosinian Conflict. Absent politics and absent whose fault it was this movie was a complete WASTE. Jolie should stick to acting in the crappy movies she stars in and forget about directing. I only watched the movie in its entirety because I was hoping it would get better and not only did it not get better it got worse. Maybe I did not pick up on the obvious but was the bar scene, at the beginning of the movie, the first time two main characters first meet? And if so are we to take from that that he will risk his live to save her when the conflict is in full gear? Not believable. When she says her final words to him "...I'm sorry..." does that mean she was in on the bombing? And for all the rave reviews out there please, Get out more.
