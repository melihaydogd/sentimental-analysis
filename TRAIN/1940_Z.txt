If you've seen any other bio pic you've seen this movie.
Very tamed version of the Dirt. Glamorizing the party life of being a rockstar, forgetting the actual dirty part of the dirt. It was skimmed over as a minor character growth. In all it seemed rushed and not respected. Seemed like a parody of Spinal Tap, but not as good.
