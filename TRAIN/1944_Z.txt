Should've killed Iris when you had the chance!!!
The show was really good until they sacrificed H.R Wells for Iris (season 3). I personally preferred Patty Spivot, Barry and Patty had the best chemistry and I really liked her. And show is getting worse by episode as it contains so much cliches and that annoying thing called IRIS.So please kill Iris and make that some kind of plot twist or great setback for the team, that won't hurt the viewers i promise.
