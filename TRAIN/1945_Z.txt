Decent crime movie badly cut.
The movie is shot well most of the actors are doing a good job, the story while not particularly original is not boring either, if someone like crime movies it should lend right in their alley.

The problem is that the second part of the movie seem rushed, like its missing 30 minutes or something. There's even a full scene missing, not to get into details this is the type of scenes that can easily be cut in a super hero type movie for comedic purposes or to show how badass the character is, but in that type of movie it just seems out of place.

Ultimately that might be the problem with this movie, it show itself like a crime movie, but it presents the principal character like a possible superhero. It's like they set themselves up in a way that if the movie is a success they could just make sequels with increasingly unrealistic scenes like so many action movies franchises have been built.
