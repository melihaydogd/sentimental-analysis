Lots of TV Episodes a LOT Funnier
My wife and I have been Simpson fans since they were first introduced on the Ullman show. We've been looking forward to the movie for months now, saw it this afternoon and BOTH of us were pretty disappointed. I don't think we laughed out loud more than four or five times throughout the entire feature and neither did anyone else in the theatre. The absence of some of the supporting characters who make the series hilarious was really apparent, and the ones who DID appear didn't add much to the "fun quotient" of the film. Reasonably boring fare, watchable, but it should have been a LOT funnier than it was. TOO BAD!!!!
