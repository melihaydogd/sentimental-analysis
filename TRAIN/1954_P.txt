Visually beautiful and atmospheric
I remember watching this movie in 2013 and I didn't like it at all. Gave it a 5.
Few months ago I remembered that I didn't like it and I wanted to give it one more go. I'm glad I did. This movie is visually beautiful and although it is very slow (I didn't mind its slowness) the atmosphere that it makes is terrific.
That said, it's not for everyone and even if you didn't like it the first time you can watch it in a few years and maybe you'll change your mind.
