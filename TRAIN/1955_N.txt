bad
Don't fool yourself, it's just bad. Don't watch it. You may thank me for this advice. I wanted to keep this comment short, because I don't want to spend more time of my life for this movie, almost three hours was enough. On the other side, the movie made me feel better about myself in some way. I mean some people spent 12 years making this (what a waste). This was refreshing, because they lost more of their life than me. This long production time doesn't show itself in the quality. I had some feeling that the cinematographers wanted to work against quality. They used the style of bad propaganda movies, typical suburban shots where you expect, that someone jumps out of a bush selling m*th to the children. Of course it would be explained too why it is bad, like everything else in this movie, they put the words in your mouth, leaving NOTHING for the imagination. I don't even mention that the main "character" is not special at all, even more boring than an average person. Oh, and he makes bad quality photos too (in this bad quality movie), living the life of an artist in a movie, which never heard of art (and he leaves his picture in the developer for "waaay" to long, listening to the schematic monologue of his teacher instead). You will find all kinds of schemes and clich√©s in this "piece of modern film history" (as they call it.), in this movie, which doesn't dare to state anything (The whole movie was like a 3 hours long "idk"). Showing alcohol like a gateway to becoming white-trash, is pro-marijuana (I guess), but only daring to show it for a split of a second. I watched every second of this movie, just to see how are they going to come out of this pit? With a highly unrealistic chick (acting like a date-raper) sitting with our high (placebo-mescaline) main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film: I don't know.
