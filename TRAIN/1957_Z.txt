'Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious'...
... and what a vicious and vulgar piece of cinema this is as Sean Connery does what Sean Connery has always excelled at i.e. playing Sean Connery. If two hours of mind numbing nonsense is what you need, and we all need to find our escapes somehow, then this will fill that void perfectly (along with several hundred other examples in the genre, most recently with Gerard Butler playing Sean Connery) - just make those leaps of faith, accept what you're told, and take comfort that 007 had the virtue to save the true patriots after they'd viciously denied him his virility.
