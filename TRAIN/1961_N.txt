Total Garbage!
This is another hit for Bettany, and another dialed-in crapfest from Crowe. I do NOT GET the adulation awarded this film by critics. The screenwriters have completely bastardized a better story.

Just for the sake of correctness, Nash didn't invent game theory as this work attempts to claim. He came up with a notion of equilibrium, which is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel. But Crowe does NOT. This was supposed to be a historical film, but due to Crowe's lackluster performance, backed up by his aggressive contractual negotiations, his character has been given credit for things he did not do! In a learned person's opinion, this is an irresponsible, and disgraceful film mainly due to Crowe's contractual screen time, which necessitated giving his character credit for things he should not have been portrayed as having done, and his totally crappy, dialed in performance.

This was a typical Hollywood whitewash of the truth, and a typical Hollywood performance by Crowe. When will they just STOP handing this untalented hack roles like this?!
