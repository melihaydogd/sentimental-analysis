One of the more enjoyable war films I've seen
I sometimes struggle with films set around the Cold War, simply because I don't find it as interesting compared to the likes of WW2 and Vietnam. 'The Courier' though was a nice surprise. It was a reasonably complicated story told in a nice easy fashion to follow. The story was well set out and it was well paced too considering there aren't a lot of action sequences (possibly none now that I think about it).

Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the lead role. He's such a likeable guy and there's something fascinating about him. He's very easy to root for. I love how overtly British he is in this movie. The whole cast were great though it has to be said.

The only thing I didn't like was a scene near the end where a character was brought in to speak to another character. It sets up a triumphant scene for the heroic characters, so I know why it had to be there, but the scene simply didn't make any sense in the context of what the Russians were trying to achieve. Otherwise though I had a great time with 'The Courier' and would recommend people give it a shot.
