Mediocre comedy
Its a harmless clichéd ridden comedy. Its identical to Hollywood films in pacing, plot and structure. Its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesn't have a sophisticated taste for movies.

The fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesn't affect the basic plot by any measurable degree. Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes. Etc The cliché goes on and on. Only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story: its extremely conventional.

The jokes can be funny sometimes. Specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic. Since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies. But overall the film is okay, but not good and is not worthy of being viewed in a theater.
