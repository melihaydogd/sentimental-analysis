I feel like I've been stumbling on movies like this a lot lately. Films with an excellent message/concept that suffer from someone just insisting on over the top artistry. In the case of Zoom, we get a movie with some very important commentary on body image, the perceptions we have of ourselves, the way our appearance impacts how others see us and how we see ourselves and our very potential. The problem is, this gets so far up inside of itself that it loses all focus. What could have been a simple and poignant film has to be twisted in a multilayered, contrived mess of a plot that's weirdly part Who Framed Roger Rabbit.This isn't an awful watch, it's just lacking in focus and restraint. Trim some of the nonessential flourishes and this turns into a pretty poignant movie that I think has a terribly important message to get across. Sadly, we get what we get and that's not a rousing success exactly. It's an interesting watch and I think it's worth checking out for fans of the cast or those who are really caught by the trailer/description but if none of that grabs you I can't say this is a must watch.
