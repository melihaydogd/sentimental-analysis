A wonderful movie for the entire family
Fast Girl is a delightful movie appropriate for all members of the family. It is beautifully shot and gives a quaint look at small town living. The movie is the story of a young woman trying to pursue her dream of becoming a race car driver. There are many people in her path to help and hinder her. Mircea Monroe is wonderful as Alex, the "Fast Girl". Justin Guarini is charming as the love interest who tries to offer her love and guidance in her quest. Dwier Brown and Caroline Rhea provide great support as Uncle Bill and Maddie. This movie has action, drama, comedy, romance and suspense. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
