Well at least the Ewoks are cute
Another fairly boring and massively overhyped sequel. The quality of acting is very poor and the narrative takes on an almost soap-opera feel at times. The special effects are generally pretty average as well and have certainly have gone backwards since the original. Overall, I just don't find the Star Wars triology to be a particularly interesting story. It's littered with flat characters, terribly executed battle scenes and extremely corny dialogue. Plus the Stormtroopers must be the most pathetic villains in the history of cinema. Did they land a single shot in any of these movies?I do enjoy Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher's performances and I love the droids, but the rest of it just looks and feels quite cheap. For a kid growing up in the 70s and 80s I fully get why this series would be so magical but in reality there are far better stories from that era. I simply do not understand how this particular trilogy became so iconic.
