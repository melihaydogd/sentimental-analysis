A piece of art, but not a good movie to watch.
First of all, I can understand why so many people in the industry like the film. It appeals to the life of actors, producers, directors and people in the film and theater industries. Maybe the movie was done by the textbook, perfect cinematography and what not... but I really don't think it deserves an Oscar just for that.

It starts out with a very vintage style. The music, the constant percussion sounds and the focus on the backstage environment makes it feel more like a "in the day of the life of..." type of documentary. It looks cheap while watching and it takes real effort to try and follow the clich√© "has-been, washout" predictable story of a man in his post-midlife blues.

Just because some famous old actor plays the lead role, and very good I might add, does not mean it is a captivating movie. It's uninspiring and it leaves one with a feeling of regret. Regret for the poor sod who made the wrong choices, regret for his daughter who struggled (struggles?) with a drug addiction, regret that he does not care a little more about other people. In fact, I'm even regretful just for watching this movie.

People who will appreciate this movie are aspiring actors, producers, directors, cameramen/women or people who like watching drama theater.

Warning to the average movie-watcher: This is not a blockbuster. It is not a typical, enjoyable movie. It's a piece of art. Not a Mona Lisa, but a Picasso - abstract and ugly, but with underlying meaning.

Movies like this are popular because of the artsy following it has, not because it appeals to everyone.

I am not interested in acting or anything to do with that industry. I just want a good movie with convincing action that takes my mind off of everyday life for a while. This is definitely NOT it.
