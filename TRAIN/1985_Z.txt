This film is not that bad
Enjoyment can be had when watching this film. Its often very funny, possibly when it isn't supposed to be funny, but who cares where the humour stems from at least its there. If this film had been done more as a pastiche than a serious superhero film, it may have survived a little better. Shot like an extra long music video, the film does have some decent directorial ideas, but they just don't come through. Pitof puts some great angles in, and often has some flair for imagination, but to often the film chops and changes set pieces and moves at such a pace that you have no time to take in the fact that the film is actually quite pretty.

The script and storyline are just terrible. Whoever is responsible should never write ever again. Killer face cream... enough said. Sharon Stone and Halle Berry do well with the little characterisation they're given. Had this been a showdown between Michelle Pfeiffers Catwoman and Sharon Stones Katherine Tramell I can't help think this film may have been a hit.

Its a real shame that this film just didn't go correctly. It is my belief that Catwoman is a great Superhero/Villain and I think if done correctly it could be great, but until then sit back, relax and take in this Catwomans absurdities. It's not good, however it is watchable.

Halle Berrys Razzie win does seem a little extreme, though her acceptance speech is brilliant.
