Effective if unspectacular courtroom drama
'Primal Fear' is a decent and moderately absorbing courtroom drama film. The plot is certainly more intelligent and methodical than the average mystery/drama, or at least it would have been if it wasn't for an unconvincing and rather predictable twist towards the ends. The big twist doesn't add much to the film as a whole and the plot just isn't absorbing enough for the twist to have the desired 'shock' effect.  Having said that, the film does a lot of things well and is effective as a courtroom drama. It owes much of its success to some very good acting and scripting. The characters are all well developed and convincing with Richard Gere and Edward Norton delivering the stand out performances. 'Primal Fear' would have been a lot better if it had focused more on these strengths rather than going down the same path as so many other murder mystery films.
