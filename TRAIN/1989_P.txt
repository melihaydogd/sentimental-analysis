I thought it was great
After reading some of the other reviews for this movie, I was beginning to wonder if I was reading about the same movie I had just seen with my grandson. I cannot believe how many reviewers did not like G-Force. My husband and I thought it was great and it kept our 4 year old grandson totally entertained the entire time. And this was despite technical difficulties at the theater that caused the movie to start almost an hour late! It was the first actual 3D movie we had seen (though we have seen other examples of 3D at amusement parks, etc.) and we very impressed. My husband and I were literally laughing out loud at our grandson ducking when things would appear to fly out the screen right at him. And I have no idea how they accomplished making the fly seem to come from the back of the theater towards the screen. The fly seemed to buzz right by my ear!! I would definitely recommend this movie.
