Entertaining - and a bit more adult than the show
I have seen the long-lived TV show only a few times a year since it began, but I've always found it amusing (if not worth tuning in for). I am also not a big fan of comedy. So, needless to say my expectations were not very high when I went to see this with some friends tonight.

The film surpassed my expectations, as the show usually does. The characterization is consistent with the series and the Addams family of the '90s is just as lovably screwed up as they have always been.

The central problem this time is that, partly due to Homer's behavior, the levels of pollution in Springfield are so high that the EPA quarantines the entire town. A lynch mob goes after the family, but they escape to Alaska to start a new life. The plot set-up is also cleverly connected to religious superstitions and mass-paranoia. This takes us about half an hour or maybe a little further into the film.

There are plenty of relatively smart jokes (compared to the average Will Ferrell flick), with some satirical political overtones, and a bit of risqu√© humor as well.

I recommend The Simpsons Movie to fans of the show, and friends of fans. While I don't really think the film is entirely appropriate for young kids, it should be fine for most of the family (teen plus).
