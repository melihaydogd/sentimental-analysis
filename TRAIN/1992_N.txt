Justified title
This will be very disappointing to the huge fan base of srk including me. Plot is quite poor with unrealistic built. As the movie progress it'll get you into more disbelief. Tho it starts with huge entrainment, the fun ride doesn't last till the end. As we seen from the past movies srk second half of the movie just let's the whole movie down same with this movie. Totally it's just dissatisfaction led after been expecting from the Anand and srk combo been not going well.
