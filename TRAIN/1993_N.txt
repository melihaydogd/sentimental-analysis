The worst film from the Studio Ghibli.
If this movie wasn't produced by the prestigious Studio Ghibli, there was no way Disney imported this mediocre-at-best film. I even suspect that Disney was forced to buy this film as a part of package, attached to other great Miyazaki films. The film is unwatchable, unless you are six years old. I would understand if it was targeted at small kids, but it was targeted at young and adult generations. The first ten minutes of the film has some freshness, but then all characters and action sequences in the cat world are just horrible. DVD contains a short documentary that explains the reason why the studio produced this film. As Miyazaki and Takahata are getting old, they are desperately looking for next generation. But if they continue to produce this level of quality movie, the studio is doomed.
