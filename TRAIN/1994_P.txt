I asked myself a question when watching this movie- would it make me love the Simpsons more, or would it ruin the show altogether?
I have to say the answer to my own question is the former. I loved the Simpsons when I was 10-12, but just over a year ago for some reason I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny and creative anymore. Anyway, The Simpsons Movie is a constantly hilarious and witty movie, that completely exceeded my expectations. Yep, it is very silly, but it is lots of fun as well. So much so, I have decided to give the show another chance. The animation is true to the style of that of the show, with crisp colourful backgrounds and excellent character animation. The music by Hans Zimmer is wonderful, while the master has done better work, the music is still pretty darn good. The theme tune is still as irresistibly catchy as it was when the show first started. The story is a good one, there are tons of hilarious moments and one or two heart-warming ones too. Grandpa's revelation in the church at the beginning was hilarious, and I liked it when Lisa finds a special boyfriend in the name of Colin. I did worry that the environmentalist message would be too heavy handed, but it was handled just right. The voice cast do an exceptional job bringing the iconic characters to life, especially Dan Castallenetta as Homer. And they were aided by some delicious dialogue. I have no real complaints of this movie, though if the film was five minutes longer, we could've learned more about EPA. Overall, I thought The Simpsons Movie was absolutely terrific. 9/10 Bethany Cox
