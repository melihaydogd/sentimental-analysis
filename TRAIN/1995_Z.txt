Great in the first half; less so in the second.
In the near future, the planet Earth is disintegrating environmentally. A team of astronauts explore outer space to check if there is another planet where Earth's remaining inhabitants can be transported in order to survive.

The first half of the film is fascinating. It has great ideas about what the future might be like considering the current levels of greed and over-population. There is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. Matthew McConaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. Playing his school-age daughter, Mackenzie Foy is no slouch either.

The second half is interesting at best; muddled, too busy and overlong at worst. There is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized.

The movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more.
