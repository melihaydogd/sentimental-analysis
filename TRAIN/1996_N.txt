PREDATOR
"PREDATOR" (1987, McTiernan) is definitely no 10/10 masterpiece. The Predator itself is fabulous. I Can't fault it.  But the film is no more than a tongue in cheek sci-fi action farce. It isn't genius, it's actually mind numbingly silly as a bunch of muscle-mounds, each a cliche, is hunted down in the jungle.  It's the "TOP GUN" (1986, Scott) of sci-fi/action films (however subversive it might be with the inclusion of a murderous alien) that outstays its welcome towards the end.  Fun acting, heel-thumping soundtrack, great monster and an influential idea make it a must watch but it ain't a flawless classic.
