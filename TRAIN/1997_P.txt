Definitely going to watch it again
As a fan of superhero films, I'm now bored of them as they are just shoving same formula and giving us repetitive crap. But Birds of Prey felt fresh and was something new.

Without spoiling much I'd only say that trailers didn't show much. The movie has lots of amazing action sequence and perfect balance of action and comedy. I'm glad they made the film R rated. Hats off to DC and WB for pushing boundary, take risk and give us something new everytime. Now after films like joker and Birds of prey, I'm really excited for upcoming films like WW84, Batman, etc

Also ignore the drama by haters as movie isn't about that at all.
