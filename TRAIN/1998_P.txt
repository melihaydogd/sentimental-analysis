Funny, truthful and very much the best of breed 80's high school picture.
Teenagers start becoming aware of sex, relationships and the need to earn extra cash in this slice-of-life high-school tale.A film that will probably not be done any justice by me or any better reviewer for the simple reason that so much of what goes on has been done so many times since. But I still believe this is the best schoolyard melodrama around and it still makes me laugh with its home truths and clever one lines.("You want romance, we can't even get cable TV!")Sean Penn is a standout as the stoned surfer who, sadly, lives nowhere near the sea. I don't believe any teacher would take time to go around anyone's house (as here) to continue the lessons, but it is a funny scene! What was presented here was taken as a model for other films that tried to boost up the sex, comedy or drama - but this film is a lesson in balance and stepping lightly that others missed. Nothing is too big a deal - not even abortion.Fast Times was a lot of fun when I saw it twenty years ago and is still fun today. True many of the actors went on to do even better work, so it is great to see them when they still had their own front teeth and even a bit of puppy fat.This is especially true of the great Jennifer Jason Leigh - one of the best American actresses of her generation. Not great here, simply very good.
