 Pretty but boring
As I started seeing the commercials for this movie I was convinced that this would be a typical fairy tale movie, not worthy of being seen.Until today I was definitely not going, but as circumstances went I wound up at the theater at 2pm, almost late, but in time for the start.The movie started nice - black stuff all over and bad guys who look like they need a lot of facial hair to cover their ugliness were all over the place.The middle was "interesting" - a lot of run and other stuff, comparable to run. Scenery was outstanding.The end was, uh, gone. Where did the end go? Someone quickly think of another hour for the ending. The end left things pretty unfinished, since the good guys neither died nor won. I think another 3 long hours for the finish would be added as a sequel or something.At the end I would say that the only thing good about this was the scenery and the cast. Nothing else is worth spending $8 and sitting in a chair for 3 hours. The plot seems full, long - 3 hours long, the story seems involving, but not to me. Overall I heard a lot of people say "why did I come here", or saw people leave a good hour before the thing was officially over.I've heard a lot of people who've already read the book say it's good and at the same time a lot of people that haven't say it's awful.If you really need to find out if it's good or not you should go see it, but if you trust me - rent it a month later for a lot less.
