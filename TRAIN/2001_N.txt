It didn't do it for me
Not only did I think this movie was awful, but most of my family did too. We thought it was completely awful, and didn't laugh once. I even tried to force myself to laugh, of funny there's a tiger in the hotel room, wait that's not funny, or is it? But the odd thing about this movie is other people I know thought it was hilarious. I watched it on my own so I'm confused about what parts others found funny. I guess what this movie lacks for me is wittiness, it's more of scenic humor possibly. I don't know how else to explain it because quite honestly I'm confused and just wish I hadn't watched it. I'd like to hear someone that understands what makes people laugh explain why it is that this movie gets so many laughs from some but none from others.
