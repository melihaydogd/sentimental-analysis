the intro was great, the rest not so
The introductory credits sequence for the movie Watchmen was amazing. It could be that i liked it because i like comic books, as well as the stories with alternate history. The rest was interesting, but only for comic book aficionados. The others might have had problems in staying awake.

The reason for initial excitement and later disappointment lays in the story itself. Back in the day when Watchem appeared, the story has been rather interesting. But so many years later it is just one of many comic books brought to screen and one of many alternate histories presented to the broader audience.

This combination was still potent, yet the complicated plot demanded a slow pace which, in turn has been simply too slow.
