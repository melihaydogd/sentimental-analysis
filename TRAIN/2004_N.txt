What the Hell???????
From reading other reviews it is now obvious this film is based on a book, my point would be that you shouldn't have to read that book first to then understand the movie. How on earth people can give this 10/10 is a joke as it does not make sense and worse of all it never try's to make sense.The only saving grace is a good performance from Scarlett Johansson, even though she only has 20 lines throughout the film she commands a great screen presence which makes the 90 minutes bearable.If i could go back in time i would chop my hand off so i couldn't load up the DVD player.
