Worth watching for Edward Norton
Primal Fear is a fine film. It's structured well, its script has the occasional neat twist, and it has an amazing performance with Edward Norton. In fact, I'd say his performance is so good it is worth watching the film just to see it.  Besides his performance, there wasn't too much remarkable about the film. For the most part it is a very by-the-numbers style courtroom drama that is coated with a somewhat cliche love story about two ex-lovers. Richard Gere and Laura Linney both deliver good performances, but they never really blew me away either. The overall story has an interesting hook, but I wish several aspects of it were taken further. Specifically, I wished more was done after learning about the corruptness of the church and its leader. That was an interesting twist and I wished the film further explored the thin line between victim and assailant regarding Edward Norton and the murdered priest character.  Overall, a fine film. On a technical level, the film is fine. The cinematography, much like the rest of the film, functions well-enough to keep interest, but is not spectacular. Primal Fear is worth watching for Norton, but it is not something I'll be returning to.
