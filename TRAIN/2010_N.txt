Much ado about nothing
Hype personified this film is little more than a routine cowboy film set in space. Good versus evil at the most banal and simplistic level imaginable. The performances are bland and uninspiring throughout.In short it's present day Hollywood doing what Hollywood does best. Hype. Not worthy of inclusion in a top 1 Million.
