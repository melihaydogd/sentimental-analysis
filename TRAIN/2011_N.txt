Even my 8-year-old was bored.
Zoom is dreck.Granted, it's a kids flick. But the classic kids flicks endure because of quality. There is no quality of any sort in this junk. Of course, when you go to a movie these days and see "Revolution Studios" before the credits, you know you're going to end up with brain-numbing rot. (The biggest mistake Sony Pictures ever made was funding Revolution. The best move Sony Pictures ever made was closing the Revolution doors -- so to speak.) Oh...and you know you're in real trouble when this appears in the opening credits: Songs by Smashmouth.Tim Allen, Courtney Cox, Chevy Chase, and poor Rip Torn...ugh. What in the world were they thinking? I know the first three aren't A-listers, but a seeing genuine talent like Torn wasted in slop such as this is depressing. "Forty Shades of Blue" one minute, "Zoom" the next. Oh well, it pays the bills, I suppose.And my, how Chase has fallen. Every now and then, a spark of his former talented self glimmers through, but mostly he's stuck doing embarrassing schtick. (One scene where his character is stuck in an "outdoor simulator" is just awful. He mugs and dances around like a second rate Rip Taylor...without the feminine traits, obviously.)
