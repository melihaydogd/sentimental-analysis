you have to be objective, this is a bad movie
Stop giving this movie a high score just because of the circumstances, does it all of sudden make this movie great? You know it doesn't deserve a 7.x on IMDb. It's a stupid, worthless movie. This fails on several, if not all levels. I couldn't even finish watching this cheesy movie, half of this juvenile trash was enough for me before I finally gave up being sadistic enough to torture myself with this.

This has such bad and unconvincing acting, especially by the star of the film, Brandon Lee. A movie with a poorly executed story is made even harder to watch when the star of the movie couldn't act his way out of a house with no walls (therefore no roof, think about it). His wife got raped and killed, what is he supposed to be, angry or campy? Why is he making jokes as he toys with his victims? This is like a damn cartoon for 10 year olds. If the movie didn't take itself so seriously, then I wouldn't mind that performance choice so much. Everything from the script and the dialog was formulaic. How can anyone think this is a great movie? It's not 100% horrible, but it ain't Spider-Man, it's Elektra, enough said.
