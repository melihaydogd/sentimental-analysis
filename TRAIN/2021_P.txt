The film is another example of a number if big budget movies about Holocust and Jewish people in world war II being massacred by Hiltler army.
The story and form of the film is moving and engage the audience in to dramatic core of the film. What I have observed more as specific talent and skill of the director is mood and tone of the film being transformed to the audience; heartbreaking sequence of the film where Jews are moved toward the gas chamber and moments later where the smoke comes out is utter shock and depression which we as audience feel it, also the camera shot choice and composition makes the sequence identical.The hand-held camera in some sequences has achieved the aim of the filmmaker to engage the audience into story shift between objective to subjective point of view. For instance where the Jewish women being run into the chamber and the doors are locked on them, apart from the suspense of being burnt in the chamber which we see is not the case and they have shower, the audience feels the tension and terror in the scene.
