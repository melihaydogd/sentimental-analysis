Another fine film by Pixar
This was the first feature film that I have seen in 3d. Before discussing the merits of 3d let's discuss the film.Pixar must be the most critically/commercially successful production company of recent times. They have no duds in their back catalogue and a number of classic movies. Up is another fine film and just fails to make classic status although I am sure many people will rank it alongside Wall E and Toy Story. Personally I found it a little bit too sweet although that's a fine line that most of the Pixar movies tread.The film follows the dreams and ambitions of a couple of kids looking for adventure, Carl and Ellie. We see a quick clip of them ageing and putting off that trip they'd always planned to South America. Before we know it, it's too late ... or is it? The great thing about the movie is that you care about the characters. It always seems a bit strange to me that for some reason it is easier to feel empathy for animated characters than real actors. I've put it down to good script writers in the past, but I'm starting to wonder if there's something else going on. Anyway I'm sure most people will love Up and that it will be many peoples favourite film of the year.As mentioned earlier, this was the first film that I have seen in 3d. I can't say it really added to my enjoyment of the film and I can't help feeling that it's a bit of a gimmick designed to increase cinema takings. I've been to several 3d presentations at theme parks, but I think that's where the technology belongs. Maybe there will be a killer app that really showcases the technology, but I don't believe 3d will add much to most films.
