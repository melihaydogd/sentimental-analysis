Excellent Flick! Would see again.
I've got to say, i went into the theater expecting to be disappointed. But i must say, the movie caught me totally off guard. The fact that there were'nt that many lines, but yet you always knew what was going on was quite impressive and enjoyable. I would'nt consider it a sequel to Daredevil, but more of a movie of it's own, though there are a few references to daredevil, nothing substantial nor had the plot have anything to do with daredevil. As for the action, i was definitely surprised, it wasn't fake looking at all, i really did enjoy it, the effects were done great as well. I'd definitely recommend seeing this one, give it a try, and never trust what critics say.

I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.
