It's a fun movie...
This movie isn't what I expected. There was a lot of talk about this movie and a lot of hype brought from it during its release year. It's a great kids film and it even holds a lot of comedy for adults.I had a lot of fun and enjoyed a lot of the great comedy throughout this movie, even though it's filled with a lot of sadness. It has a clich√© montage in the first ten minutes to show a lot of time passing and allow for the main character of Carl to be old.Russel is quite a show-stealing character with his comedic relief and the dog Dug who is a hyper-active upbeat talking dog helps give some comedy too. It's really unlimited in terms of comedy.It's got a tad bit of romance, and it's filled with tragedy for more than one character. It's a fun movie full of heart. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm sad I didn't take a look at it in 2009 when it came out. But I'm glad I finally saw it. It's one of the best Pixar has ever had to offer.
