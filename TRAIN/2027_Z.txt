The Big Dud
I just had the unfortunate experience of watching The Big Lebowski for the first time. All I can say is that I'm amazed at its popularity. It's hard to comprehend people actually like this overrated dud and claim it's funny and entertaining. As if the muddled and overloaded script and plot weren't enough, the characters aren't the least bit interesting to watch. Jeff Bridges' character is an unemployed loser, and for that reason alone, we're suppose to think he's "really cool". I bet slacker misfits must be the only ones who could identify with such character. Moreover, John Goodman's character is downright obnoxious. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro are wasted in nonsensical roles. Plus, the laughs are few and far between. The cliff scene when John Goodman scatters Steve Buscemi's ashes but the wind blows them on to Jeff Bridges' face, is probably the funniest bit in the whole movie. Everything else seems forced. The music is forgettable and if you want a better display of Roger Deakins' cinematography, I suggest you see a better Coen brothers' film - O Brother, Where Art Thou? To think this film came from the same people who brought us Fargo and Blood Simple.
