Nothing special, read the book
This isn't the worst movie ever, but don't buy the hype about a message movie. The message is heavy handed and poorly executed (note I am not saying I disagree with it or it is propaganda, it just isn't very good). Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are wonderful, I mean I would watch N.P. eat breakfast and be happy, but certain aspects of their interactions are gut wrenchingly cliché and silly. The plot stresses simplicity and often the audience is informed of things rather than shown them just to make sure no one got lost on the straight as an arrow plot. Unfortunately simplicity does not prevent plot holes and this movie is rife with inconsistencies, omissions, pointless twists, a huge subplot with no resolution and perhaps the most cliché romantic dialogue imaginable. It isn't horrible, it isn't The Day After Tomorrow or Troy (prime examples of terrible blockbusters) but it is standard Hollywood fare and any message presented is done far more compellingly elsewhere no matter what your politics (it borrows a lot of it's ideologies from Bowling for Columbine). Go see the movie if you want some so-so escapist far, but you could get something better off the netflix queue without trying too hard (Brazil springs to mind). If you want to see the story done right, read the book.
