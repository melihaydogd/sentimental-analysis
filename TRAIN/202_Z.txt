Highly overrated!
I simply cannot understand why this film rated so highly. The best part was Emma Stone's acting but other than that there is virtually nothing worth praising. If this was an attempt to revive the classic film musicals of the forties and fifties it fails utterly in my opinion. The main problem is that Emma Stone can't sing and Ryan Gosling can't act. Another problem is that in many of the other musical numbers including the opening one in the LA traffic jam you can't hear the lyrics. As an actor Ryan Gosling reminds me of sixties actor David Jansen who played Richard Kimble in the Fugitive TV series - he has one or at the most two facial expressions. Overall the story is fairly boring too. I'm writing this review about two weeks after seeing the movie and I have no desire to see it again.

I'm probably being generous in rating this 4/10.
