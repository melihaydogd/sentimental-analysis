Bad acting, bad writing, predictable ending
"V for Vendetta" was well dressed, bad movie. It was well funded and starred Natalie Portman, so it looked great, but the writing and the plot were awful. It was plain, predictable, lacking excitement, lacking originality, and generally lacking the ability to draw me into the fiction, engage with the characters, and make me forget I was watching a movie. The underlying political message couldn't have been more obvious if they had spoon fed it to you in 3D. (Don't think this review is about bias; my personal politics are pretty much in line with the film's.) As "movie people" (film and its trivia is a hobby and pastime - thank heaven for Netflix), my wife and I typically pick them well... and I'm a big fan of comic book themed or stylized films... but for only the second time in 15 years of going to the movies together, we discovered afterward that we had both considered suggesting just leaving half-way in. (The only other was "Waiting to Exhale.")
