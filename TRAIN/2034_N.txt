I don't know how it ends
Once an actor has been in a movie with an evil counterculture end and as the bad guy I don't trust movies that actor is in anymore. Kevin Spacey is one such actor. I was half watching Se7en for a long time while I was doing some work on the computer, thinking I wish I knew the remote control was. Near the end I realized that Kevin Spacey was John Doe but he was in jail so I let it go on a little longer. When I heard Morgan Freeman say that John Doe had the upper hand I had to get up fast and change the channel. I still don't know how it ends.There really should be a rating system that a movie has a bad ending so that guys like me don;t get suckered into watching crap like this.
