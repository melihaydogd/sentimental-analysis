The Falcon was created in the seventies so Cap could travel around the country and have topical storylines confronting social ills. Especially racism. That's initially why the character was black. Don't be so hypersensitive. It would be dumb to have a Falcon series and not have it be what the character was intended for; a way to show the conflict between ideals and reality.
