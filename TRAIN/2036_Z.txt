A film of sexual freedom and women liberation
This film contains gay, lesbian and bisexual characters. The overall plot is attractive and intelligent but the descriptions on individual characters are rather weak. The change of the characters' emotion and decisions could not be clearly explained by the plot. It requires exaggerated imaginations and interpretations.

The music and shooting style are quite classic and are decently made. It would be an excellent film for those middle-aged women who have to work at their home every day. It involves the excitement of travel and the freedom a woman should have.

Several points can definitely make us laugh. It is a relaxing and easy film so it certainly worths you HKD$50 to enjoy it.
