not good because of singin in the rain
Singin the rain. an artist man and woman that at the first have some struggle between themselves, but after that, they fall in love together. in La La Land after showing the difference between modern music and classical jazz for Sebastian, it reminds me the changing of silent movies to sound movies in the Singin the rain. I just think Singin the rain is better than La La Land.
