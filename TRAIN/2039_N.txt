Oh my God was that AWFUL or what!!!
Nothing, not one laugh, I tried, I like Jim Carrey, I know I tried to laugh, I wanted to be a YES MAN but during this I was the embodiment of the NO MAN!

Plot is predictable all the way throughout, even cornier than I expected... but I was hoping for silly laughs at least, no.

Acting was lame really. No one stood out. Jim Carrey looks like he was desperate to film anything, as if his carrier was Pauly Shorish, which I can now imagine it can be if he keeps on doing this.

I can't say much about the movie, it's just bad all over, do yourselves a favor and skip it.
