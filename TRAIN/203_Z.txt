OK action/philosophy flick, not exactly sci fi
This is not really a sci fi movie like the first two. It's OK, but the philosophy in this movie is more philisophical double talk than serious philosophy like in the second movie.

I was hoping for a return to the action/sci-fi flick the original was, where they actually provide *explanations* for what happened and cut the BS, but that's not to be found in this one. You will leave the theatre wondering why anything happened in the movie.
