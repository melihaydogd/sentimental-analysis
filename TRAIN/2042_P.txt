Clearly underrated
Reviewers that don't actually pay attention to the movie, shouldn't be allowed to post in here. "Teen angst and too much drama"?? PAY ATTENTION and you would see that every line in this movie, every look, every gesture, adds up the back stories and matters. Some of these reviewers have NO clue what they are talking about. All the reviews that rate under 4 stars are clearly not REAL sci-fi fans. This movie was well made, and just plain awesome. My only complaint, is that it wasn't longer. I want to see more, and I really hope there's a sequel....or better yet, a series. Great movie. All these negative reviewers are just sad, bored little haters that have no idea what good sci-fi even looks like. Comparing it to Stranger Things and X-men? What movie did these people watch? It sure wasn't this one. I loved it!
