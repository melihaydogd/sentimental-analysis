The Invisible Man's Wife!
An interesting modern take on the invisible man concept in this twisted mind game nightmare yet it comes with the lack of the invisible man presence! An abused wife escapes her narcissist and sadistic husband to her friend's house only to know after a couple of weeks that he committed suicide, in what seems like a happy ending for her turns out to be hell as she feels her husband's presence around here almost everywhere which leads her to suspect that he's still alive and won't let her go this easy.

So far the idea sounds interesting but for a general thriller, not revival of a classic, I believe the plot should've been approached with more of a homage to the classic adaption. I know the idea of taking chemical potions to become invisible is over used but a plot mix between modern technology and past methods would've been a better choice, I already have couple of ideas on how to do so just by writing this.

Elisabeth Moss carries the movie well, yet the movie feels more like "The Invisible Man's Wife" story more than being The Invisible Man story! Practically almost the whole movie is focused on the wife, her mental suffering and what she's going through, you can barley see/sense any character development or acting from the invisible man at all. Some scenes are very predictable like you can almost see through but it's a nice piece of a (general thriller) for the most part.
