'Quilt' can't decide what it say; nevertheless it's a decent story.
I would not normally choose to watch this type of movie, but it was the only thing on TV that was in English. Having said that, there was enough to keep me interested.

Movies based on books must make trade-offs in terms of what stays and what goes. 'Quilt' couldn't make up its mind what to cut, so there is a bit of everything. I felt the movie was on fast forward for the entire time.

The message was also a bit muddled. All men are schmucks? All women are schmucks? (but just more discreet about it). Marriage is crap? Marriage is about love? (i.e. the "where love reside" them of the quilt.

At the end of the day, I expect a movie such as this to tell a good story. Stories, like real life, don't necessarily have clear messages. So putting all the artistic crap aside, this movie had a nice little story, and it was a decent way to spend a few hours.
