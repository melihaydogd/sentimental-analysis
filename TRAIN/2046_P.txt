Awesome - ignore the bad reviews, please!!!
Please do not listen to these negative people on here who are so wrong! This movie scared the heck out of me and kept my adrenaline high the whole time, my finace was scared as well, we are huge horror buffs and this is the first movie in a long time that actually scared us.

Little girl was phenominal, its wonderful to finally see a good horror movie with good acting - its been a while, Kevin Bacon, amazing as always, stir of echos scared me as a child this was even better. Wish he did more horrors honestly hes great at it. How anyone didnt like this movie is beyond me? I hineslty feel like some people just have such crappy lives that they dont enjoy anything. This movie was so good like it actually bothered me reading these reviews.

Ten stars. Its currently 3:20 in the morning and i havent slept because i am still creeped out. This hasnt happened to me in years.
