Should be better
As one review stated, the movie isn't completely honest. I'm a war child from Bosnia and truth to be told, reality was far more different than the one showed in the movie: it was worse. Still, the movie is pretty good with really nice acting and solid plot. I liked camera work a lot and the message of the movie (which is not strong enough but ... well it's still there) You should not be carried away with emotions since I didn't and I lived to tell the story of a war. There are far better movies about war in Bosnia (No man's land, probably the best) but since this is Angelina's first movie as director, it is not that bad.
