Enjoyable creature feature
A group of friends venture into the deep woods for a weekend getaway. Things go nightmarishly awry when the group find themselves trapped in a remote cabin by a ferocious bloodthirsty monster.

Director Brett Simmons keeps the familiar, yet still effective and engrossing story moving at a brisk pace, makes nice use of the beauteous sylvan setting, builds a considerable amount of tension, maintains a grimly serious tone throughout, delivers a handy helping of graphic gore, and stages the attack scenes with savage aplomb. The compact script by Thommy Hutson and Catherine Trillo draws the characters with some depth, offers a few bleak insights into the darker aspects of human nature, and isn't quite as predictable as one might expect given the tried'n'true premise. The sturdy acting by the able cast keeps this movie humming: Joey Lauren Adams as the feisty Vicky, Elizabeth Gillies as the vain Mandy, Jeremy Sumpter as the noble Matt, Keke Palmer as the sassy Alissa, Patrick Young as macho jerk Jeff, Paul Iacono as obnoxious third wheel Sean, Amaury Nolasco as cynical coward Douglas, and Thorsten Kaye as the pragmatic Carl. The filmmakers deserve extra props for going with a funky old school guy in a monster suit over cruddy CGI. Scott Wining's crisp widescreen cinematography and the spirited shivery score by tomandandy are both up to par. A worthy beast feast.
