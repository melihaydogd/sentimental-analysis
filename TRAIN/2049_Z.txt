Good for action movie (and Yancy Butler) fans.
I admit that I didn't have many expectations from this movie: I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but just an ordinary, violent action movie, which also happened to have Yancy Butler starring in it(and that's even better.)And that was all I got. So I suggest this movie to all action movie fans and also to Yancy Butler fans, like I am. You're definitely going to like it.
