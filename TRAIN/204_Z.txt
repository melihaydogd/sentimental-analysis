Memorable film of Jewish oppression during WWII
This film is for those older than 16. It is not a chic flick nor a family film. It is a thought provoking film dealing with the Jewish oppression in WWII. The film captures your attention and holds it throughout the film. The actors Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley and Ralph Fiennes do give a stellar performance. However, it is the supporting cast which makes the film work. I would have rated it higher if the film could have stayed within my 2 hour bottom limit. Although a memorable film and a film which deals with such a politically charged subject, I feel that I was not so entertained as I was educated, even though it is a work of fiction. Not a film for those wanting entertainment. It is a thought provoking film that all should watch at some time.
