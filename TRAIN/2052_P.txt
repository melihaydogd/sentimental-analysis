A not so little gem along the others!
My first comment is among these days when films are fast & supposed to be exciting this film is slow with subtle words and actions. It is so rare to witness that. I should recommend watching more films like this one. Not to mention the performance of the actors who give this feeling. I don't about the crew or producers, but the director Paolo Sorrentino had nailed it - all of it!
