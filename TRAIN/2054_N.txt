2 stars cause the ending was good
I love QT, but I'm sorry, I get it's intent and it's art and I'm an older man so I understood all the references, but this movie bored the heck out of me. I sat there and watched and watched and waited. Pacino was good, Margot dancing was probably some of the best scenes, and the crazy ending. Either than that, it wasn't anything special.
