Dezi Arnaz Jr. can act!
Who knew that Dezi Arnaz Jr. could act?! Well, sortof. Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, John Carradine, Sheila Keith and Julie Peasgood do most of the acting for him and make him look fairly acceptable as the straight man/hero. There's lots of fun here, with all the long time Kings of horror who were living at the time this was made. Enough plot twists to keep you guessing. Lots of secret passages and mysterious happenings. Scooby Doo would be right at home. Production values are pretty good. Some genuine scares that might be too much for the little ones in your family, not enough gore for the hard-core slasher fans. Contains my favorite Vincent Price line of all time: "Please, don't interrupt me whilst I am soliloquizing!"
