A Fairytale only Tarantino Could Make
Wonderful, thrilling film. This is what should have happened but didn't happen. I left the theater in a trance, knowing what really went down. This is Quentin's fantasy of a Hollywood that wasn't plagued by Manson. Though all performances are great, Brad Pitt an all-star as a problematic man who may or may not have killed his wife. And Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect as a depressed TV star. The real MVP is the pitbull Brandy -- best dog actor I have ever seen.
