Not My Cup of Tea
Admittedly, Under the Tuscan Sun is not really my type of movie. Going home for a weekend to see my parents and my sister, I really had no objection to seeing this movie. Like the old saying goes, "Don't knock it until you try it," because some movies may surprise you. Well, Under the Tuscan Sun didn't really do that for me.This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think my mom and sister enjoyed it, particularly the joke about the "butt facial toilet." My dad and I chuckled, but we weren't really bowled over. The scenery was pretty nice, and I imagine this movie is great for people that either want to go to Italy or have fond memories of vacations there. I didn't fit in any of those categories, so that wasn't much of a big deal to me.Really, the only redeeming factor for me in this movie was Diane Lane. She is definitely one of the most beautiful actresses around. I think I can watch her in about anything. No matter how bad the movie may be, as long as Diane Lane was in it, that movie wouldn't be a complete loss!In conclusion, I don't feel I can slam this movie too harshly, because I am definitely not its target market. I think it does have great appeal to certain audiences out there, but for me, it wasn't anything special.My IMDb Rating: 5/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: C+ (Flawed but Worthy)
