Theater quality programming on Television
One of the best pieces of television I have seen. Among the ranks with the Sopranos, Mad Men, etc.. Costner fans know he has always been fascinated with the west. Dances with Wolves, Open Range, Silverado. Costner doesn't need to make movies or TV shows anymore. He is a great writer. Given the quality writing and cinematography depicted in Yellowstone, Costner is clearly enjoying making this one. Excellent acting across the cast and the fact that most of the actors are not household names, makes the characters more interesting. I would urge anyone who likes smart dramas to watch this series. If you like westerns, you can's miss it.
