Good young actors in good old times
The movie appears to have all the necessary premises to be successful in any given aspect: famous young actors, quite a promising beginning and even some unexpected twists in the plot.  However, some of its particularities spoil the whole impression. First and foremost, the story itself is not as exciting to watch as it's initially presented: some of its threads are revolving around political and financial intrigues - rather a boring background, whereas the mystery itself is short and quite straightforward apart from several rare turns. On top of that, the main female character's image is not developed enough: she lacks any emotions or memorable traits except obsessing about smoking and being ready to succumb to this dirty habit at any moment or place.  As for the virtues of the movie, the other main personalities are quite good and believable, even though one might not feel for any of them. Additionally, it's indeed a pleasure to watch the actors playing them since they are still young and vibrant. What's more, the atmosphere of those old times feels very nostalgic and noirish.
