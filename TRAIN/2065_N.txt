Stunningly Bad Streep Performance
Painfully overacted. Streep made it annoyingly obvious that we were watching an actor. Her signature snootiness and dragged out inflections, pregnant pauses, hitched sentences, glasses fidgetting, head-in-hands dismay, stare-downs, etc etc etc...ugh, ugh, ugh....all contrived. In dusting off all her trademark-isms, she sinks the ship.

Dialogue so dull it can't be resurrected...not even by Hanks.

Even the suspenseful music felt contrived.

A movie trying so hard to be important....thinking it was making a big difference....taking itself so seriously that it was almost humorous.

Can't blame the film technique because ....well...Bob Odenkirk. He overcame all the bad cards he was dealt and rose above the abysmal film emerging as the best performer in the group.
