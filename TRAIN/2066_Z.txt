Ridiculous action gets tiresome
Hannibal (Liam Neeson), Face (Bradley Cooper), B.A. Baracus (Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson), and Murdock (Sharlto Copley) are Iraqi vets who were wrongly imprisoned for stealing US currency printing plates. They escape from prison to recover the plates, but they may be double crossed once again.

Liam Neeson is too grumpy. Bradley Cooper is good having fun with Face. Sharlto Copley is a bad Murdock. The problem is that these characters are so iconic in TV history. Other than Cooper, nobody really hit it on the head.

This is just an excuse to put in ridiculous action. It's all very disappointing. It's missing the heart of the TV show. It's missing the humor and the chemistry of the group.
