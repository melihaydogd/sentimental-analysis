Good movie
I'm going to have to disagree with the critics on this one.I can't believe that Elektra got such a bad score. I mean at least a high six for god sakes. This movie was a great action movie and Garner showed her physical abilities in this movie. The dialogue was a bit crisp sometimes and got a little thin with the usual martial arts "You can do it" and that type of inspiring stuff. The movie, overall, is very entertaining and the acting is good. There were a lot of great special effects. The editing was OK. There were complaints on how the main guy died... I thought the death could've been more elaborate and more vengeful. The story isn't bad at all. I guess it's just a matter of taste, if you like movies that are closer to the reality side, go watch another movie, if you're open to things that aren't really tied in with what's real, you might like this. It's action packed and plot-wise, well it's actually not that bad. Elektra is lost in morality and doesn't know who she is, by the ending she finds herself again... with the help of people along the way. The little love thing they had going, i don't know about that, there was hardly any chemistry although both actors were capable. The movie was well done and is good enough for me to be expecting a sequel, just keep in mind, this is more of the definition of Elektra and finding who she is. Maybe, in the next movie, if there is one, there'll be more sense of reality to it. Have fun with it.
