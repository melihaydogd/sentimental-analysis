A split Review

Me watching this in the 80's as a teen:

You get caught up in the Rocky style 'you can do it' emotion, the films great strength. Pat seemed like a sweet old guy.

Me watching this movie as an adult: OMG this is awful. Condescending picture painted of martial arts. The stupidest fight techniques ever put to film. So cheesy. So basic in its good guy v bad guy. If you enjoy this as an adult for any reason other than nostalgia (which is valid) then seek professional help.
