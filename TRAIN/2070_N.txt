Terrible
Apart from the odd jumpy bit there is a serious amount of quality. Whoever wrote this script will hopefully never write another one, unless its for scary movie, possibly. People were openly laughing at some of the lines, the lack of attention to the script ruined the movie for me, made it lose all of its scare factor completely. The only excuse for this is if they were actually trying to make some of the characters purposely funny. The actors lack of quality made this even harder to interpret. They managed to create a house full of unbelievable characters. Towards the end I felt like I was watching home alone meets scary movie. Very poor show. The plot also lacked depth, at the end we don't fully understand how what has happened, happened. There were so many moments that were laughable. I honestly don't understand how anyone could ever think this is a good piece of cinema at all. Save you're money and don't see it.
