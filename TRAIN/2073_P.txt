Great, but not 3 hours great
Great film, very entertaining, but it was way too long. It didn't need to be 3 hours long. I have no problem with a film being 3 hours long, IF it has 3 hours worth of quality material. This film does not. Most films do not, that is why they are edited down, to remove the fluff, to keep the audience.

They spent WAY too much time developing the background stories of both Denham and Ann, even though neither background story had any impact on the film as a whole, nor the film's climax, nor anything beyond reaching the island.

Peter Jackson seems to think that just because it worked for the Lord of The Rings trilogy, that he can make every film with an extended running time. What he fails to realize, is that one of the most important skills in film making, if being able to cut the film down to it's best and most entertaining edit. The LOTR films had so much material, because of Tolken, not Jackson... Save the fluff footage for DVD extras. Or what is the point of editing in the first place?

This is King Kong. It is not a historical epic like Gettysburg or Braveheart. This is King Kong, not a brilliant story like Seven Samuri.

This film was very entertaining, eventually, once it got going. I enjoyed it, and will probably purchase the DVD. I recommend it to everyone, but, ONLY if you are able to sit through the fluff to get to the actual film. Most of you will turn it off before seeing it's brilliance. This film succeeds in making the viewer feel for "the beast", and they really bring out the love story between "beauty and the beast" very well.
