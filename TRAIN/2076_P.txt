One of the biggest influences in Hollywood
Akira Kurosawa created what is highly regarded as one of the best films ever made and it deserves the recognition. Whenever you watch Star Wars or a Spielberg film you see the influence that this film had on those works. I wasnt huge on the film the first time but the more you watch the film, the more appreciation youll get for it. The story centres around a small group of samurai defending a small village from a large group of marauding bandits. The film is in black and white and entirely in Japanese, set in feudal Japan but dont let that put anyone off, its superbly written and really entertaining
