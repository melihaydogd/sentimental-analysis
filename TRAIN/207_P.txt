Kong proves exceptional
Just to warn everybody reading this, there are really no spoilers in this, just a comment on the type of scene, such as what it contains. (I.e.-animal scene, etc.) Other comments on the movie are vague.

Having neither the chance nor the pocketbook to make such a movie, Peter Jackson, after successfully weaving the Lord of the Rings trilogy, has now created what supposedly was his dream. After seeing this movie, it is obvious that he didn't take it lightly. To sum things up, King Kong was truly the most phenomenal movie I have seen all year. The special effects were breathtaking, and remarkable was the magnificent imagery which will surely pull in the visual effects Oscar. The movie even lacked unnecessary sub-plots, which can sometimes make or break a film. (Only one dissatisfied meÂ…the Jimmy sub-plot) Even the acting was well thought out. Although I am a fan of Adrian Brody (The Pianist), he proved exceptional as Jack Driscoll in the movie. Naomi Watts played a beautiful, mysterious character that is surely worthy of some serious recognition. But of all the actors, it was Jack Black who surprised me most. I must admit, after movies such as Envy and School of Rock, I had virtually no respect for him as an actor. Black proved he can play different kind of character. Enter Carl Denham, a filmmaker just trying to scrape ends meat in the 30's. Black uncovers Denham's passion for film-making, and brings him to a whole new level. Even if you are a fan of the original 1933 addition of King Kong, there are some memoirs to the film, such as a few lines written in and a bug scene, which was so hair raising that it made Jurassic Park look like a kiddy convention. Kong himself was not a deus ex machina, as one might have expected. He was someone longing for a companion. If you've been disappointed with films this year as I have, then go see King Kong. It will surely brighten your spirits.
