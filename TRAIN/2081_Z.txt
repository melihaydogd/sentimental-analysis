For fans of musicals
La La Land since its release has received a lot of praise and due from critics and award shows, having earning several Oscar awards as well as other prestigious awards. Just as with every film that received high praise from critics and wins a ton of awards, there will be a lot of backlash and critics among casual movie goers alike. For those whom don't like too much musicals may not enjoy this film as this film offers plenty in that area. The story is well decent and the acting and visuals complete it. La La Land is quite decent but the story is something in which we have seen before (at times the film reminds of a musical version of the Notebook). Was not much of a fan of some of the musicals they had as one found them to be not as interesting and forgettable. Overall, if you are not a fan of old fashion type musicals, or predictable romance stories, La Land Land may not be for you, as one should not try to force the film to enjoy it.
