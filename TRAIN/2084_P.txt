Unbelievable
This movie is just absolutely remarkable. I could talk about everything that was amazing for hours and hours. Nothing about this movie is wrong. The script is beautiful, the message is beautiful, the music is freaking OUTSTANDING, and the overall look of the movie tops everything else i've ever seen. The combination and balance of color makes this movie so appealing. One of my favorite things too is that every setting is real. There's no green screen used anywhere. You get real city shots and gorgeously painted sets. I've watched this movie 7 times and counting, and constantly catch myself singing Justin Hurwitz's incredibly composed music. Just EVERYTHING about La La Land makes it a MUST watch. And you'll need to re-watch it a few times as well.
