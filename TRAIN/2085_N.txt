What a pretentious piece of drivel
Before I am slated as a Terminator-loving twit, let me say that I love films of all genres. I am open for anything, as long as it challenges me and doesn't turn my brain off completely. I always took IMDb seriously, but seeing this film on #173 of Top 250 films makes me strongly doubt the intelligence of this site's average user. The story is horribly copied from other classics, i.e. not original, the plot is full of illogical holes, it is totally unbelievable and the lesbian woman subplot made my toes curl. This film is totally overrated and embarrassingly bad. Even 1 Star seems inflated. If you want to watch intelligent cinema dealing with the future, watch Brazil.
