Too strange to hold much meaning unless you're a historian
Sadly I'm not a big fan of surrealist films. Zerograd (or City Zero) is a film that feels like it takes place in a strange unnatural world. It has some grounding in the fact that the main character seems to recognize how everything is strange, so he's going on this journey with us, but the lack of any cohesive story structure was more than I could bear. I do recognize that there is a purpose underlying all of this, because Zerograd was made at a particular time in Russian history when things were changing dramatically, and the filmmakers were trying to make a point about the strange new world they were experiencing. However, since I don't have a strong connection to that time and place in history, the film felt like nonsense. Not only did it feel strange, but it also had a somewhat frustrating storyline because the protagonist was being mistreated and forced into an unfair position. By the end, without spoiling anything, I was more annoyed than ever and it left me feeling hopeless. I'm confident that, for those who might have lived through these events or those who are interested in exploring the history of Post-Soviet Russia, Zerograd could be an interesting film to explore and analyze. For me, however, it was merely an oddity that meant very little. While there are strange and humorous moments that I'll never forget, that didn't make for a story that engaged me in any fashion.
