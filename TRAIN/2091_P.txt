People can change.
Schindler's List is an amazing story and a great documentation of how we can change as people.A man with greedy,immoral intentions can become a man whom statues are erected in honor of.Liam Neeson gives an amazing performance as Oskar Schindler,a greedy business man who uses Jewish folk as cheap labor and is totally blind to how he is helping them as a people.Neeson's slow character transformation was a thing of beauty to watch and great support was given by Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.It is also the best documentation of just how things were for the Jewish community during the WWII era and I would highly recommend it to all who love great cinema.
