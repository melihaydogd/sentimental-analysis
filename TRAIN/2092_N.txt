Not a Comedy
This is just a long boring crime movie with no mystery and fewer jokes. This movie has no more comical moments than any other "action" movie. Jeff Bridges is not a comedian nor funny, and is insolent in his satire. He is just another terrible actor riding his parents coattails. The Coen Brother are also not comic writers, frankly, they are the definition of overrated. Writing long boring movies isn't being deep, it's writing long boring movies. This film fails to entertain, unless you are some uptight over privileged classist who has never met real people, and enjoy the mockery of the lower class. There is a reason this bombed the box office...
