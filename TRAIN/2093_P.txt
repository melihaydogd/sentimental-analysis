This is a MUST WATCH!
Many people may not agree with me and my review.This is my very first review I've ever done for any movie, this movie took me by surprise! The movie delivers powerful and believable performance from Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff.even the kids portrayed by: Garrett Ryan and Annalise Basso did an excellent performance considering their age! The script is well written and there is no typical horror movie clich√©.the soundtrack features creepy gut wrenching base that never get's old, followed by very high "screeky" terrifying sounds! The Newton Brothers did a good job on it IMO.And the ending was satisfying and left you with a new small fear for mirrors.This is the best horror movie yet! Sure every movie has it flaw but this one it's pretty hard to put your finger on it.
