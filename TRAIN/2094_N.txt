What a waste
I am unhappy that I wasted 6 bucks to rent this. I did not even make it half way and was fighting to stay awake. I love the Happy Potter series - read all the books and say all the movies in theaters. I still rematch the movies when they are on TV. This is beyond disappointing. It has absolutely no redeeming factors - except perhaps that I did not waste even more money at the theater. I will never read or watch anything again by this author. This is trash.
