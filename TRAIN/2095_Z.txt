Hollywood sucks, Go to a Play
Just saw Birdman (Michael Keaton, Ed Norton, Emma Stone...) last night. It reminded me of A Prairie Home Companion, a little preachy and a mix of theater humor with fantasy play. I know the ratings are off the chart here, but I have to say, they are waaaaaay blown over proportion here. The movie was OK, but the performances weren't commiserate to the cast's caliber. With this cast, you would expect, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof... Instead, you get Bill the Cat... Like there is a scene where Ed is talking to the theater critic and you can see is eyeline is off here face and it looks like he's reading cue cards behind her.

This movie was in love with itself. It was so enamored with its close ups and rants about self loathing and theater superiority over Hollywood garb, that it forgets that it's a movie that supposed to grip the audience.

I get it, this was one big middle finger to Hollywood and how we are lemmings for enjoying action movies and should pull our head out of our asses and go to a play... Well if your plays are like this movies, no wonder you're starving...
