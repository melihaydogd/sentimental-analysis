Keep it confidential and never tell me.
When I first saw the commercial for this movie, I was interested to see it. When people were buzzing about how good it was, I was really interested.

After seeing it, I simply shrugged. I thought it was very boring and I didn't think Kim Basinger was that great. Although I liked Crowe and Spacey in this, I didn't like any of the others like Divito and Guy Pearce. After all the oscar stuff, I even saw it again and still nothing.

To this day I still can't think what is so great about it or remember any scenes that really stick out. It reminds me of another really dumb and idiotic movie called Forrest Gump. I am glad Titanic beat this pile of rubbish.
