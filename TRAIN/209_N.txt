Room shows that living in one room all the time is boring
This movie has appeal, mainly to women and feminine types, based only on emotion.<br/><br/>The strength and devotion of the mother toward her child is well portrayed, however, and the boy does a great job of acting like a spoiled and over-protected child. The mother&#39;s love in spoiling the boy, given the terrible circumstances, is quite loving and appropriate though.<br/><br/>The movie is boring as would be living in a small room for 5 years without ever going out. That is the essence of this film.<br/><br/>Naturally the critics, and those with more emotion than intellect, are gushing over it.<br/><br/>Watch it and find out if I am wrong.
