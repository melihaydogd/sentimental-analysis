Terrible
This is a terrible movie, the acting is pure ham, the giggling is just unbearable and everybody being called Mr. this and Mr. that it's so boring I wanted to watch the New Jersey Devils play instead, now that's saying something. The fact that this movie was celebrated is absolutely appalling, I understand it was probably made for women, but still I cannot help but wonder why something so boring has been made and re-made so many times, you'd think once, even twice would be enough. Keira Knightly has reached a new point of annoying in this film. I will give it some props, it does have some wonderful scenery, and Donald Sutherland is a very fine actor, the mother pimping her daughters was just awful too. I give this movie 12 thumbs down.
