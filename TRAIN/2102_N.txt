Way too violent
This movie has a good and interesting story line but It is way too graphic and violent that It needs to be. People rate this movie so high simply because of the blood, gore, violence, and disturbing deaths. The violence is so unnecessary and is simply in the movie cause for some reason people just love It so much, it's sickening.
