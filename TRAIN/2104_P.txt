Had heart, soul and passion; Brilliant
I rewatched King Kong yesterday and was amazed at how wonderful it was, that I had not remembered it being. It's excellently paced, though some call it too long, and incredibly well played and thought out, with breathtaking performances, lovable characters brought by the amazing, superb cast and crew, and most of all a loving, humane, sensitive King Kong. There's no doubt for me that this captivating adventure is the best telling of King Kong to date.

The original was bland and boring with annoying characters and a cardboard King Kong; What Peter Jackson does with this story is put in a heart and should to give it edge and pizazz. It's fun, genuinely moving, never stops being interesting or entertaining, and will leave you wanting more from it's unimaginable excitement and quirky "beauty and the beast" sense. Naomi Watts gives one of her best performances, and other characters like Jack and Jimmy are so well played and structured that you grow to care for more than just one main character, including King Kong itself in this version; I felt compassion when he fell from the Empire building, because the movie takes so much time setting up all these different aspects and creating a true to heart and sincere atmosphere to where you will be shocked, riveted and blown away by it's surprising brilliance and succumb to a beautiful, awe inspiring story that deserves two big thumbs up for the vividness and intensity it portrays.

I loved this King Kong, and thought it to be tantalizing to every sense, leaving me feeling like I had spent my time and money on an actual and worthy movie, and not just some long, droning mess. It's passionate, mournful, subtle, satisfying, intense, and an impressive achievement in every field overall, end of story.
