Pretty tame
Despite a spirited performance from Marcia Do Vales and a solid performance from Emily Atack, there's nothing here to recommend. There are zombies and there's the Spanish location -- as it says on the tin -- but there's nothing novel here. And this is pretty tame in terms of zombie action and pretty lacklustre when it comes to comedy.
