Story ends 40 years ago
As much as I hate single paragraph "reviews", I'm just writing this to tell you this doesn't even mention "Rough Boy" (one of the greatest songs of all time, and the music video is still impressive in 2020), not to mention "Sharped dressed man", "Viva Las Vegas", "Sleeping Bag", not to mention "Pincushion" which was recorded like 10 years after all of those, not to mention... you get the point, nothing was mentioned.The story literally ends around 1980 and there's no Afterburner (whiskey foxtrot tango!) or anything that followed. You get involved in the story, they mention early MTV and the "Gimme All Your Lovin" video and the car (which of course starred in "Rough Boy"), and the next they say is basically "and so we play together to this day, wow!", like nothing else ever happened. I don't understand. If a sequel is coming in another 40 years, not only will it be hard to conduct interviews with the band, I won't be alive to watch it, so for now, please accept this score of thumbs down.
