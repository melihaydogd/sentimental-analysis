5.8 out of 10 stars.
Watchmen l watched this again recently but this time while using the fast forward button a lot. Basically, Zack Snyder is awesome when it comes to visuals and that is about it. The clown just doesn't have what it takes to direct a film unless someone is holding his hand along the way. I still need the read the original Watchmen comic. Darn, just from the story, budget and acting - this film could have been one of the greatest films ever made. What a shame.
