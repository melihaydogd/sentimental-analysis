not feeling it
The previews were intriguing: the creative genius of Pixar tackling the human psyche on a fundamental level.

Unfortunately, this film dragged on with very little plot or substance. The anthropomorphic representations of emotion and memory are cute, but ultimately fail to provide the kind of sustained entertainment experience of other Pixar films. Basically, it seemed like enough story to fill out a short - repeated several times to make a feature.

Perhaps the film does capture the essence of pre-teen, middle class white girl angst - and it does have a few very poignant moments - but ultimately, it lacks the layered humor, well directed action, and general entertainment value that I have come to expect from Pixar.

On a brighter note, the short that preceded this film, "Lava", was awesome!
