I really love this movie
i really love this movie, its got to be one of my favorites. Brandon Lee does an amazing job and deserves credit beyond words for this film. He captures the character in a great way and has really great on set chemistry with all of the other actors. I love the way that the flashbacks are shown, in exaggerated bright colors. Probably my favorite thing about this movie is the way is it shown. Everything is dark and i think that that really gives you a stronger feeling about the movie. Overall, i really love watching this movie. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and you don't get bored of it because you discover different things about it every time. I highly recommend this movie.
