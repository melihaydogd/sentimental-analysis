Bemused Sorrow
I don't know what people were expecting from this movie. I think everyone was expecting something different to happen. Everything that is supposed to happen that was said was going to happen in the other films happens. Do people not like the way it happened? Everything feels like everyone is capable of doing more than their character does. Like Neo for instance, he mostly has the role of fighting and he always does it really well. But yet, it feels like he is about to make a break through to something else, but never does. This movie revolves so much more around everyone else other than Neo. It's worth watching everyone struggle, so much passion in everyone. So much love in it with everyone, you can really feel it. That made me feel happy in a sad way. The last fight scene by far is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in a live action movie. But i won't give it a 10 just because of that. It was like watching an anime. A beautiful, very well done Anime. Still I simply feel like I've been hit over the head really hard with something not hard like a bat, but more like a bulky big back pack, and I don't feel like saying anything back to the people that did it, because it felt good in a way, but not really. It's just like you walk away cause you cant stay behind, you simply have to move on. I can just say I wish this movie had been better although it was pretty good. I wish I could love it, but I cant.
