A Decent Movie Yet I Dozed Off Watching It
Not a bad movie, this has a good cast and I love anything about people with super abilities, But this one really is a slow burner that fails to take off..i would say there are but a few moments in the whole movie and the very end is good but could have been Great...The director never gives it its wings...Pity.. great actresses here who arent given enough to work with..I actually dozed off during it, yeah, its That slow...If you are looking for Incredible displays of otherworldly power you will be dissapointed...If ur looking for a brisk pace that keeps you on the edge of ur seat, this is Not it.. You would better enjoy an episode of Heroes.... A decent movie though that could have been a Great one!
