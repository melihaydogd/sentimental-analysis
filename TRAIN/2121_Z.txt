I'm disappointed..
Well, i just registered.. just for commenting bout this movie.. i don't know what to say.. I'm a big fan of Avatar: The Legend of Aang.. And i expected the movie would be great as well.. But, it just ... well i don't know.. you should tell me..

Something bout the movie doesn't seem right for me.. What i can't tell here, I've been expecting this movie since last year (since I've watch the trailer), but it turn out to be kinda disappointed..

The 3D also doesn't impress me at all.. The fighting should be using the bending.. Not using physical strength.. Also, Appa is very ugly in this movie.. It suppose 2 be cute...
