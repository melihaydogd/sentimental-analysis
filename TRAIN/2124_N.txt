Offensively unoriginal and cheesy
This is a very sophomoric film. I'd recommend this movie to teenage boys, as a few other reviewers have, but I'd have hated this stupid, boring cheese fest of a john wick knockoff even when I was a kid.

Totally unoriginal, cliche plot. Boring in every way.

Bad dialogue Bad pacing Plot holes

I don't need my action movie to be realostic in every way, but it needs to at least create a world interesting enough for me to suspend disbelief. This movie completely failed in this regard.

If you have good taste in film, don't waste your time with this.
