Perhaps the most overrated movie of al times

I can only imagine the reason this movie hit the top 20 of all time is because the majority of users to this site are under twenty. This is a cult film pure and simple. Did it hold your interests because of the tremendous story line or acting - NO! The movie is effective simply because the audience is trying to figure out exactly what is going on in a moment of boredom -like trying to solve a crossword puzzle being worked out by the passenger in the next seat when you look over their shoulder. You watch it because it is there and you might as well be somewhat amused while continuing to be bored.

Grossly overrated - The ending is a total disappointment. I wished I hadn't wasted my time - and yes I did get the theme.
