Great but only for its target audience
By tying thousands of balloon to his home, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen sets out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America. Right after lifting off, however, he learns he isn't alone on his journey, since Russell, a wilderness explorer 70 years his junior, has inadvertently become a stowaway on the trip...I finally got a chance to watch the critically acclaimed "Up" and here are my thoughts: Up is great; but only for its target audience which is young kids. Although Pixar has mixed things around a bit this time by, introducing an elderly character and briefly approaching such themes as life and death,loss,loneliness and the passing of time,the film is clearly children oriented. Sure, it is uplifting,vibrant and fun and the animation and gci is great but its also crazy,unrealistic and ridiculous. I don't think anyone older then 7/8 years old will take this film seriously. As a kids films, I think Up is tremendous,probably a delight for any kid and I would rate it possibly as 8 or 9; as an overall film, its almost a disgrace. But how could it not be? This film shouldn't even be compared to regular films because it has a very exclusive and limited target audience.Has yet to be made a film that can be fully enjoyed by people of all ages.5/10
