 Very overrated!!
Fellowship of the rings (alongside the other two parts of the LOTR series) is a very overrated movie. It's an average movie that only has it's special effects to rely on. Tolkien's story of the ring has suffered a very poor transfer to the big screen and the fact that the complete result lasts for about 9 hours is unbelievable. I nearly fell asleep in the cinema during fellowship of the ring. The two towers had a little more action to it so I at least could keep awake without actually yawning or anything.Bottomline is: I don't understand why people go so crazy about the LOTR movies. They're really not that great!!                    2 out of 4 found this helpful.
