Tired old generic formula
Yet again a movie about a lone (american) man that saves the day and kills all the (foreign) bad guys. OMG Hollywood this again. Who writes this crap. Seen it a million times before. Back in the day it was still cool but now just shameless.Cliché after cliché, no humor, virtually no story, illogical, plot holes, action is somewhat enjoyableTo my shame i must admit i enjoyed some of the mindless action scenes but the biggest problem is that it is all to far fetched. Without any realistic basis it just looks stupid. Denzel isn't helping either. Don't get me wrong i like Denzel and credits to him for trying, but his (over) acting feels out of place. He is just trying to hard and way to serious in a movie you can't take serious.
