This is how you end a Legacy.
I don&#39;t know what happened here, I had such high hopes going in. They spend 3/4 of the movie setting up for 20 minutes of action in some tunnels and then it&#39;s over. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the grand finish to Rambo. I&#39;m so disappointed. I wanted this movie to be great
