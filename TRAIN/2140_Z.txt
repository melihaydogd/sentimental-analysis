Science fiction, not horror. Does NOT match the trailer.
Unfortunately for this film, the trailer appears to promise a standard, formulaic horror film with teenagers doing stupid, occult things and dying horribly for our entertainment. People who show up to watch it, expecting that kind of movie, will be very disappointed and likely confused and bored. It is more accurate to say this is a Gothic-Lovecraftian psychological thriller/mystery. It's not scary, more atmospheric with creepy moments, and it would actually fall solidly under the umbrella of science fiction, instead of horror. "Damaged ex-cop stumbles upon an ancient, Scientology-esque cult attempting to 'manifest' an inter-dimensional being on this plane of existence; mind-effery on the nature and meaning of reality ensues" is my attempt at a synopsis. You will enjoy this film if you like: -Lovecraft anything -Mind twisty things, like wondering if reality is real -Reading 'dark' and 'gritty' graphic novels with complicated plots (I believe it's actually based on one) -Noir science fiction You will not like it if you just wanted a horror film. The film is largely well done for what it is, but unfortunately the people who will enjoy it and the people who will go see it are unlikely to be the same people due to its advertising.
