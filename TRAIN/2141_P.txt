flashy fast
Was it just me, or was the movie really really fast, blurry, and kind of drifted. I felt as though everything was going so fast, I couldn't breath, listen, register, and sink in the words and thoughts of the movie. And it was surprising how Eve & V from the beginning were so comfortable with each other. Natalie played Eve as though there was no real character choices. Like it was her portraying herself instead of the character. The movie makes me want to read the book, and see for myself. And I've read and watched F451, 1985, etc... and this movie reminded me of a combination of those books. Movies these days are so sensationalized, and even audiences are getting tired of it, and seeing past the hype and are laughing at the style.
