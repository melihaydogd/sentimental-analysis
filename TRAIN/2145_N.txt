Horrendous! Not so much ill-conceived as poorly implemented
I only give this 2 instead of 1, so that another may attempt a worse rendition of this play.

The whole thing is like "90's slacker" meets "shakespeare" meets "typical modern use of little stylistic clips - to substitute for proper cinema" meets "artsy modern garbage".

I particularly loathe Ethan's performance - uninspired, pretentious, and melodramatic. It's not that he can't act - he was great in Training Day. But the material with this format certainly doesn't suit. The cast in general has loads of great people, and the script is proved :-) So ... the director really screwed this up. Lastly, Bill Murray - Love him - but this is not the role for him.

Save your time - truly - this version is not worth your time.
