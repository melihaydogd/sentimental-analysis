Terrible Documentary
The only reason I can imagine someone rating this greater than one star would be mistaking this documentary for the "The Science of Fasting". It's actually rather surprising that Dr. Fung provided commentary, although his portion was well put together and relevant. After the first portion, it becomes completely anectdotal and irrelevant... comparing intermittent fasting with the Donner Party? Was that for real? There are so many great resources out there regarding fasting, Dr. Fung's book, The Complete Guide to Fasting, being one of them. This documentary throws out tons of misinformation and felt like an infomercial for various products and "youtube channels".
