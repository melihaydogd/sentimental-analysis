Top action/thriller flick
Much better than the 1994 remake starring Baldwin and Basinger. As always, McQueen is fantastic here as thief "Doc McCoy" who's wife has just helped him out of prison. His screen presence is incredibly strong, and as usual he plays the the King of Cool to a tee. MacGraw, as his wife "Carol", turns in a solid performance (and looks ravishingly gorgeous as well), and the chemistry between her and McQueen is palpable (it's no surprise that they married after shooting this film), even though they barely touch each other (save for one or two kissing scenes). But there's noticeable angst and frustration between Doc and Carol; not only because he's been in jail for a few years, but also because Doc learns that Carol prostituted herself to get him out of jail. Ultimately, of course, this husband and wife team of thieves just can't live without each other. The action moves along at a good pace, and the car chases and shooting scenes are top notch - not fake like other action movies during the time. From the bank robbery to the various problems the couple face trying to escape to Mexico, the film is exciting and thrilling. It's also a bonus hoot to see McQueen and MacGraw (two of the biggest stars of the time) dumped at a garbage tip and covered in garbage.Very good action film.
