Slow-paced nothingness
I just love it when nearly 2.5 hour run-time serves no purpose. This movie is so slow even handicapped subhuman-monkey hybrid could keep up with the story.

It seems like that is a common factor here on IMDb. Good movies always get Metascore of 30/100 and IMDb rating of 4-7/10 or something like that. Then L.A. Confidential, a movie you don't even have to watch to see it, gets 90/100 because f i n a l l y . s o m e t h i n g . e v e n .

Truly a great movie if you are a bit slow, or maybe maybe deaf/don't care about audio. That way you can put it play on 2-4x speed and maybe enjoy the ride a bit more.
