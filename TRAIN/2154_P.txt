Uncontrollable jealousy towards filmmakers
I was not a big fan of musicals. I basically did not like to watch such a huge popular films...

However, LaLaLand is different from any other movies. This shows the positive and negative sides of creators, artists, and performers with such a soft, moody, and beautiful ways.

It was my first time to have felt strong jealousy toward everyone who got involved with this great movie when I was watching end roll. Thank you for creating such an amazing feeling in my mind through this great work!
