Larson ruined it.
I expected this to be a really moving experience. WOW, all those awards for Brie Larson: every group that had an award gave it to her. What I want to know is whyWhyWHY? It was a flat, uninspired performance that bored me to utter distraction. The child was just irritating: I wanted to feel empathy and concern, but I just didn&#39;t get it from his performance. I know it&#39;s unfair to be critical of a child, but so much of the movie depended on liking him that even a neutral response undercuts the whole experience. Rotten Tomatoes compilation of of professional and audience reviews are bot 93%. Are you kidding me? I think that this is one of those &quot;Emperor-Has-No-Clothes&quot; situations. Very few reviewers wanted to be contrarians: I&#39;d be willing to bet that if they were given an honesty potion, that the results would be muchMuchMUCH different. What a waste of my life.
