Did not see the first one...
so, this may seem to some a biased review, but the theme of the movie and its' execution was brilliant to me. Never been a fan of Josh Brolin, but now I am blown away by his acting chops in this. His Dad should be proud. This movie is totally unique and given the fact that the original is of Asian extraction I can say a "thank you" to the makers for this English remake so that I may watch (and appreciate) such amazing content and "get it". This films unique character has left me breathless and I know that no other film will come close to satisfying me in the same way for a long, long time. KUDOS! Job well done!!
