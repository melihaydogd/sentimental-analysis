Complete Total Rubbish
The actors are mostly fine,although I have never liked anything Paul Dano has done, but the dialogue is stilted pseudo intellectual absurdest, claptrap. I seldom feel so annoyed as this movie made me feel. What a waste of talent and time. It tries to manipulate the viewer but there is not one real moment in the whole bloated mess. I do not understand how it has a rating as high as it is, Of course as a small art film, it has probably had a certain type of self indulgent audience, who see what is not there. I have seen films that tried for something different,off kilter, or surprising, which were in some way successful, meaningful, and/or entertaining. This is not one of those films.
