Wish I had my money back and two hours of my life
From all the positive reviews I was looking forward to this film. Boy. what a letdown. Wish my wife and I had walked out a little earlier and enjoyed a day in the park or maybe a cat video. Acting is over the top by the two "pros" and everyone else is annoyingly bad. I would love to know the age and film going experience of the reviewers who loved this trashy little film. Have they not seen the classic films from the last 75 years so they have a point of reference? Have reviewing standards really slipped this far? I almost feel sorry for Russell Crowe having to endure this one. I wasted a couple of hours and $18. Crowe spent months on this humorless exercise. Hope he lost a little weight in the process and was well compensated. Save your money and time.
