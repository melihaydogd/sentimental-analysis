Extremely boring
I'm sorry to say this, but this movie lost me after 10-20 minutes, and it never caught my attention again. I see alot of ppl like this movie, but I found it really boring. For me it didn't have anything. It didn't have good action scenes, interesting story, and besides I don't like the 1950-style. If it only had some underlying symbolism or something like that... I think that symbolism in a movie should strike u clearly; u shall feel there is something more. But no, it didn't have a striking symbolism either. Just a straight forward story about some dirty cops catching some very dirty cops (all the cops in this movie I would say was dirty).

The only reason I watched the whole movie, and didn't stop watching after 10-20 minutes, was that a pal of mine told me that it was not a movie with "brainless action" that one should stop watching after merely 20 minutes just because I didn't like it. So i had a real boring time forcing me to watch it almost to the end. I skipped the last 10 minutes; it was not like anything supprising would happen that made up for the past 2 hours of bordome.

I would give this movie 1.5 on a scale from 0 to 10.
