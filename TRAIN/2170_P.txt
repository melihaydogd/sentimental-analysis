A classic.
One of the deepest most sophisticated nuanced super hero movies ever. Production quality is amazing. The story is complex and long but worth the payoff. The acting is great overall. The hero's are vulnerable in so many ways. For every ability they have they suffer from even worse flaws. This is an alternate universe that forks from historical events. Rorschach is my favorite anti hero of all time and the end for me is an emotional powerful climax thats always a gut punch. Soundtrack is spot on. Should have won an Oscar or at least a nomination for any number of categories imo. Genre changing idea as profound and well crafted as the first matrix by comparison. Wouldn't be surprised if the MCU borrowed many ideas from this epic. I have no history with this franchise as a graphic novel and can only judge as a fan of the movie.
