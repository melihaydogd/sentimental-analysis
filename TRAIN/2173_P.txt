"G" is a great movie
I think the movie "G" puts an interesting and suspenseful spin on a boring and non-captivating novel. I was required to read "Great Gatsby" my senior year in high school, and we my class got a chance to view it at a film festival we were all amazed. Christopher Scott Cherot made me fall in love with a plot line that I had previously not cared for at all. It was a brilliant idea to take a bland setting and prodominately white characters and put a hip-hop spin on it. The climax of the movie can use a little work, but the movie is awesome as is.
