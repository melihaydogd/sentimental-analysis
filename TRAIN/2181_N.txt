 WHAT A JOKE!
That this movie could be #1 on IMDB's list only shows that there are major problems with how that list is generated.  I dislike critics as much as anyone, but there needs to be some safeguard against droves of mindless fans exulting a movie that has little more going for it than hype and special effects.  To be fair, the acting was very good, but I can't say more for it because the utter lack of character development in the film ruined any chance for great performances.Others have already pointed out how cliche most of the scenarios and action was and how long the film dragged on for, so I'll just mention my major complaint - the complete lack of continuity, in any respect.  A perfect microcosm was the horse chase where Arwen is at one moment surrounded by the dark riders, who seem to ride at twice her speed to catch up, while in the next cut she has somehow opened up a thirty foot lead - pretty typical of bad action movies, but not of the best movie of all time!Poor portrayal action is only a minor complaint, but continuity is lacking on a much grander scale in this film.  Characters just don't have any consistent qualities - is Sam really very close to Frodo? or is that just how hobbits are? How could the great Gandalf have been so mistaken about his mentor?  The groups decisions while treking through middle earth are asinine - they are halfway across a mountain range and then decide to head back and go through a hellish cavern where they are sure to die.  All this because Frodo gave the ok, but who would expect reason from a group that decided to bring along three extra bumbling fools, as if defeating the supreme evil power wasn't challenge enough.I could go on and on, but this movie isn't worth the webspace.  I just hope that in the end people see some reason and give it the 3 or 4 out of 10 it deserves.
