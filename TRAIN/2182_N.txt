Painfully Bland And As Exciting As Watching Paint Dry
I started watching it because of its reputation and its cast. I switched it off after half an hour and watched a John Wayne war movie instead because very little happened in "The King's Speech".

The dialog, at best, was tepid and the background music was awful.

Like other reviewers have noticed, there's a lack of colour. It's as if the budget allowed the set and costume designers to use only blue, black, and brown with a sprinkling of white.

And, like other reviewers have commented, the performances were disappointing.

I got the impression that whoever approved the production of this film thought that because "Downton Abbey" was a hit, anything that is about the British aristocracy or monarchy would be one as well. It didn't work with me, though. I got bored with DA and stopped watching during its third season. Similarly, I stopped watching "The King's Speech" for the same reason.

How this movie managed to win the Best Picture Oscar is a mystery to me.
