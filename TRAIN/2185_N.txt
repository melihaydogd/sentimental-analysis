2.5 hours of irretrievable time
So the film starts with a promising air to it, the pace is good and you're thinking oooo this is gonna be good...   That's short lived  The rest of the film is just long drawn out randomness... It was 80/90% predictable throughout.  There are tons of wtf are you doing moments too...  There are a couple scenes where the director must have said to the editor "whatever, do whatever you want". The story seems all chronological and then There is a random leap forward which suggested that they had way too much footage and had struggled to squeeze into an already extra long movie...  I mean if you can tell the story in an hour and half you're not doing it right..,seems these days 2 hours is standard but this goes into 2.5 hours! And then instead of ending where it should have and throwing in the culminating scenes all together they drag it out some more and try to be clever with an open ending roll credits moment where you sit there for a second in disbelief than they could have the audacity to do that to viewers.. Then you look at the others in the room and everyone sighs and huge wtf kind of ending was that.
