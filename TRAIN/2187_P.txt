Wonderfully funny, charming and entertaining
Happily living with the Browns in London, Paddington Bear is looking for a gift to give his adopted mother, Aunt Lucy, for her 100th birthday. He discovers the perfect gift but cannot afford it and is framed when it is stolen.  Wonderfully funny, charming and entertaining. The first Paddington movie, from 2014, was great. At first glance a children's movie, it was great no matter what age you are. Solid plot and very funny, with a wonderful English whimsicalness and quirkiness.  Paddington 2 takes that formula and improves upon it, ending even better than the initial movie, a rarity. Even funnier, even more emotional and the warmth, innocence and charm are all there too. Interesting, entertaining plot that moves at a brisk pace.  Another factor in what makes Paddington 2 so great is the performance of Hugh Grant. He absolutely steals the show as the villainous Phoenix Buchanan.  Superb movie, and suitable for all ages.
