just a senseless, expensive absurdity
I watched the first half of this film in cinema and went out. Normally I try to stay in the film even if it's bad, but I couldn't this time. They showed it in the free TV and I again tried to watch it. That was before a year or so and I'm still searching for the sense of this film. Well, I think I have to surrender. What's the sense to show the last hours of the worlds greatest tyrant who killed millions of human beings?? This film gives you the intention that the allies were the bad guys. What's the sense to make a film which intention obviously is to have pity on Adolf Hitler. So, what happened? Of course, children who don't know much about history yet feel sorry for him. I heard a little girl say: "Mum, why does everyone hate him? I think he's nice". I was close to puking when I heard that, but I couldn't accuse her. I would have thought of it the same way, when I was child.
