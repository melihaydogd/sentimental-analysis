dystopia 101
Heavy-handed like little I've seen this year. Not particularly innovative, nor well-executed. As a native Spanish speaker, I found the dialogue bland, boring and repetitive. Didn't find most characters interesting, either, but the premise is absorbing and it manages to keep you interested. I'm always here for a good dystopia, and even if blunt, the story delivers its lesson effectively.
