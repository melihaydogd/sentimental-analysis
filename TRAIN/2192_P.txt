Strangely Enjoyable
I wasn't even sure I wanted to watch this film when it came on at 11:20 pm. I was tired and a little let down after having just finished watching Clear and Present Danger (had heard great things about it). But I decided to watch the first 5 minutes or so as the listing description claimed it to be an "Adult Claymation". I was intrigued as I do have quite an interest in claymation myself. The minutes rolled on by and soon half an hour had been and gone already. Within that half hour I had felt happy, sad, sympathetic, uncomfortable, frustrated, confused the list goes on. This film has a marvellous ability to switch between moods in the blink of an eye in a way that doesn't seem obnoxious or intrusive. The subject matter made me squirm a little at first, however that is quickly accounted for and you are eventually put at ease. All I can say is give this film a chance. It drags on a little in places, well, it drags on throughout the entire film really. There is no action, only one particularly intense scene I can recall and due to the story there is very little character to character to dialogue. Yet somehow it is so gloriously intriguing you can get past that. It's a bitter-sweet film that may leave some with a bit of a bad taste in their mouth having finished watching it. But to those willing to put a little effort in I can guarantee an enjoyable and incredibly deep watch. It get's a 7 from me. Whilst there were no major issues there was also nothing that really stood out about this film other than the story. Animation was somewhat lacklustre even despite the gloomy setting of the plot, acting was a little frayed round the edges at times and I did find myself rolling my eyes to a few parts that were seemingly supposed to be emotional. However, it's a good all-rounder on all fronts bar the outstanding writing. If you are going to give this a go, make sure to have some tissues handy. You have been warned
