Brilliant entertainment.
This was a brilliant film. Theatrical, magical awesome set piece after setpiece. No idea what critics are on about. Focus is on minutiae of cgi, who blooming cares, all looked shiny and other worldly to me, had cat ears and looked furry, what more do you need. Hatchet jobs are utterly baffling. Film has nothing profound to say, but is absolutely pure entertainment. All actors performed very well, no continuity between scenes, but that was nature of stage musical. Music was fabulous throughout.Whole thing is an absurd contrivance of overblown silliness, and absolutely wonderful for it.
