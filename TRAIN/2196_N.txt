It feels very forced
The amount of times this show tries to bring up leftist view of the world is unimaginable. This went from being a half decent teen show to political cringefest. The characters don't even have an ounce of rationale, they still look the world through their butterfly filter. The bickering between Sam and James is unbearable, zemo seems more reasonable than the supposed avengers.
