Creepy As Hell
I had to give this film a five because who gives a ten to a film that leaves you feeling creepy. Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job and I wouldn't be shocked if the right people thought he was Oscar worthy, but this film made me want to back away from the theater slowly.

Louis Bloom is the person smart people cross the street to get away from. His sociopathic moves throughout the movie made me wonder why I ever thought he might be portrayed as an under dog at some major turning point in the story. Boy was I wrong. I would say this movie was good because it left you feeling something and because Gyllenhaal will, without doubt, make you believe he is this character.

If you're looking for a feel good movie, don't see this. I would even recommend Gone Girl before this film. I literally feel sexually violated by the film. Now excuse me while I sit in a shower for the next hour, washing the memory of Night Crawler out of my brain.
