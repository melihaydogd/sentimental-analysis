Austen on speed
Just like the 1940 version, this one seems like it's on speed. There's rarely time for a breath! Granted they've taken a complex novel and condensed it into 2 plus hours, but every bit of dialog seems rushed. There's little time for anyone to respond much less react.   What I really minded most was the choice of leaving everyone but Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) out of the story. We see nothing of her sister Jane, little of her interest in Bingley, none of the caustic wit of Bingley's sister, none of Wickham's dalliances, none of Lydia's stupidity. In fact, I saw so little of Darcy, that I wondered at any attraction.   Some of the changes from the novel were disturbing. Why was Charlotte Lucas an old maid instead of someone who simply wasn't romantic? What's with all the chickens in the Bennet's front lawn?   For this to work, the viewer must understand that there was incredible prejudice on everyone's behalf -- not just Darcy's. That Lady Catherine was just as embarrassing as Mrs. Bennet. But unfortunately, there doesn't seem to have been enough time for any of this. A shame really, because there were moments to be enjoyed.
