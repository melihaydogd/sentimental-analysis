Decent, could've been better
I wouldn't have said Matthew was the best role for Inspector Gadget, but after seeing the movie, I had a change of heart. Although it's not really close to the original, it's a funny interpretation of the character. I know it's a Disney movie, but I do wish they didn't make such corny jokes and were a little more serious from time to time. I like the addition of the Gadget mobile being a living car; He turned out to be a funny character! I also love Gadget's origin story and crush on Brenda! They fit the character well. Although Penny and Brain ended up not doing much in the whole movie, which was a little disappointing. But, I did enjoy the fact Gadget was able to save the day on his own rather then receiving their help like he always does in the series. It shows even though he's naive, he's learning! I knew this movie was born to have a sequel, but the sequel was so awful I wish I could unsee it! Never watch the sequel, guys!!
