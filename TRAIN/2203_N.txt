Po more like Poo (get it?)
Out of all the atrocious things I could spend my time on this "film" was the worst possible thing. If there's any person who would say that this is their favourite movie, I would like to bonk them in the head. I did not laugh once at any of the lines. We get it, Po is fat, but the movie recycles that joke again and again and again. The animation is standard at best, it does not shine nor could it be considered beautiful. The villain is average, the plot is very archetypal and the action scenes are boring. I left the theatre stiff. I only wish that less movies were like this and more like the classic "Jurassic World." 

Thank you good night
