The only anime movie I've ever seen and liked
I've never been a big fan of anime.Granted, I've only seen a handful of anime films, but they've never really interested me. So when a friend threw a copy of Spirited Away in my hands and said, "You've gotta watch this!" I was less than thrilled, but decided to give it a try.I'm glad I did.The little girl in the movie is made to seem very real. She has all the mannerisms and quirks of a normal, bratty little girl. She is suddenly cast into a surreal world of spirits in which she must be brave and take care of herself.The unique characters and fascinating artwork make this fun to watch. These aren't your stereotypical cutesy anime characters either. The film really branches out and has diverse characters that keep you guessing.If I can think of anything negative about this movie, it might have run on a few minutes too long, but that's a small point, and can easily be overlooked.So, I'm still not going to rush out and watch all the anime films I can, but for those of you who (like me) have decided that you don't care for anime, allow this to be the rare exception.9 of 10
