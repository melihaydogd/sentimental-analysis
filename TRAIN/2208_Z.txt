Typical genre movie supported by those in that genre
Take a film about actors and then ask the acting fraternity to judge it. Of course they loved it as the various characters and their volatile natures are likely to have a part the judges can identify with. For the rest of us it is boring illogical rubbish with only a few moments of relief. Other posts refer to past events in which case this.movie has fallen into the same trap as other currently unfolding sagas. Looking at reviews of say Hunger Games the up-ticks and favorable reviews are by people who have read the books. I suppose they also form a genre, that of a ready made fan club. Unfortunately fan clubs like to support their own and so the voting is slewed. I am becoming very disillusioned with the voting process. Anyway back to birdman: Edward Norton started very strongly but quickly started to wane. Oh dear, was I thinking of Bruce Wayne when I composed that sentence? Would that Birdman had something we could connect with. I liked the joy on daughters face as presumably she spotted father sailing about outside. What else was there? Nothing.
