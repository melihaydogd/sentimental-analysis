Don't go out of your way to watch this
With so many zombie movies out there you never know how a movie is going to pan out. This one had a unique slant of being a movie about zombies being over run by zombies so there was great potential there, however the script was cheap and nasty and the acting second rate.Half of the movie was non-zombie and the rest of full of clich√©s - hell there was even a zombie boob shot. So when you add it all up, it was a movie where a lot of effort was put into production and it will never amount to much/anything. Which is as sad for the actors as for the movie itself and the limited viewing it will achieve.Part of me wanting to watch this movie was shallow....I wanted to see Jocelyn Christian who I had seen randomly on NZ TV from time to time. There's a lot of potential in her as she has great screen presence and an amazing smile.Don't waste your time with this one sorry to say.
