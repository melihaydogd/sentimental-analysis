OK just
slow and drab...dancing was terrible in both technique and choreography. Only one tune was good and that played throughout the whole movie. On a positive note,it was a far more realistic portrayal which I liked compared to the usual American artificial stuff. But it was not a powerful awesome story that deserves such high rating...it reminded me of another Ryan Gosling movie that had awesome reviews, called Drive. It was so slow and the dialogue was so slow...I laughed during an emotional stare between the 2 in love as no words came out...perhaps this is a Ryan thing that he gets away with as he is kinda cute and lovable so you cannot help but like him...so my only conclusion is slow movies must be arty hence get the ratings. Whereas I like a movie to "entertain me" and this and La la land did not.
