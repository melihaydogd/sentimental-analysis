The movie G,
This was an excellent movie and I would LOVE to get my own personal copy. If anyone could please tell me if and when is the release date of this movie on DVD? I went to see this movie alone as I usually go to the movies with my children. This was one I felt like seeing alone and I'm really glad I did. Blair Underwood is a really handsome brother and so is the brother that played Summer G., sorry I can't remember his name at the moment. I have been searching everywhere for this movie and every time I ask someone about it like at Hollywood video ,they look at me as if I were an alien. The movie was excellent I just can't understand why no one seems to know what I'm talking about, when I ask about it.
