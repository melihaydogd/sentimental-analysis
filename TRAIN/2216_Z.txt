It's pretty bad
It goes one of two ways for the actors in this movie: either they overact so hard it's painful, or they just don't bother acting at all. MGK is terrible, but you can tell he can play the drums. And the way it's presented is somehow different from other "bad boy rock n roll guys" biopics I've seen before. It just feels like a collection of stuff that happened to some guys in the 80's. I got the feeling you could mix up most of the scenes and put them wherever you wanted and it would work out about the same. Would have given it about two stars, but the early rehearsal and show scenes seemed pretty real. A lot of times in these kinds of movies the guys all meet each other and play together and it sounds perfect right away. They tried to make it sound and feel like a real band just getting their music together. Overall, I'd rather watch the VH1 behind the music.
