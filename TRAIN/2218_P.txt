Ahead of its time
I still can't believe this came out in 1982. It looks like it was made a lot later with better technology.. I mean 1982 had some real old lookin stinkers and E.T. was so ahead of it's time, back when Spielberg was in his prime!! I remember seeing this at the theater multiple times and I was born in December of 1977 so I couldn't have been any older than 4! I am watching it with my two girls as I type this. They are ages 10 and 8 and they are absolutely mesmerized lol.. also I'd like to point out the GREAT acting especially by Henry Thomas (Elliot). If you ever get a chance to look on YouTube, look up his original audition for this movie. It'll blow you away.. Anyway, E.T. is a timeless classic not to ever be forgotten. The people rating it a 1 who are saying it was boring need to stick with their "Transformers" movies lol
