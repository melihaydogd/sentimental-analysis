Slow burn coming of age comedy
This movie was a slow burn but the point that it was trying to make came across. As someone who grew up catholic, I knew exactly what she was going through and how "catholic guilt" can get you when you are trying to figure out who you are as a person and it sucks. Natalie portrayed that very well and how we all try to hide who we are or we will be struck down by God. One of my only gripes was that it was a little slow at times but I loved the main characters story of embracing who you are.
