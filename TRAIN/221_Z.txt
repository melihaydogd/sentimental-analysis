I wish they went further with it
For a film depicting some of the craziest people and moments in the history of rock and roll, it sure does play it safe. The Dirt is a pretty formulaic rock biopic about the notorious Motley Crue. As a fan of the band, I was definitely interested in seeing their debauchery detailed on film. While there is some fun to be had enjoying the music and craziness, the movie just doesn't go far enough in covering their absurd exploits. There's too much condensed into too small of a window. Machine Gun Kelly is perfectly cast as Tommy Lee and the rest of the cast is decent. I wish that the filmmakers put a little more effort into realistically showcasing the story of such an infamous band.
