Repetitive, boring Mad Max barely does anything in it.

To be honest I went into watching this film with a negative mind anyway as I had heard that it was just crazy people driving round a desert. They were not wrong. It was terrible. Tom hardy just grunts most of the time and it is called mad max but it is barely about him. He doesn't do much in it. It is just people driving through the desert with unexplained things happening in it. And then when I finally had a feeling of relief because I thought the film had ended it hadn't, they pick up some old ladies and turn back round and go down the same way they just came from to have very similar fights, in the same places, with the same people except the old ladies they pick up die. So it's just pointless but rubbish fighting all the way through with big cars, lots of fire and no good story. This is a typical boys film. I normally love action films with cars and fights but this was just repetitive and boring.it didn't excite me, make me laugh, shock me or make me want to know what was going to happen next. Waste of two hours of my life.
