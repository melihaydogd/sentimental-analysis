One of my "worst-ever" films
I happened to watch this film by accident with a friend and both of us were soon deeply embarrassed to be sitting in the cinema with people who actually enjoy this. The humour is totally obnoxious and the values are somehow all wrong. I also saw the version with Jerry Lewis and I don't think the two films are alike in the way they use humour. If Jerry Lewis bears any resemblance to another living actor than maybe to Jim Carrey (for example in "Me, Myself and Irene") but never to Eddie Murphy.
