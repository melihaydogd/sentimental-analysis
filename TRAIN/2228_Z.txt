Eastwood tries, and fails, to be politically correct - it was better when he wasn't trying.
"It's a helluva thing - killing a man.  You take away all he has ... and all he's gonna have."  Say that with as if you're Cecil B. DeMille reciting from the Book of Genesis and as slowly as possible, and you'll have some idea of what "Unforgiven" feels like.  It's one self-important speech after another, as Eastwood tries to atone for the sins of much better films like "Pale Rider".It all starts when a prostitute is violently beaten by a client.  He had a comically small penis, and she laughed at it ... Yes, that really is what happens.  It's not only implausible: it's a forced genuflection towards feminism, and just the first in a long line of forced genuflections. Anyway, the prostitutes are unable to exact legal revenge on the man, so they offer a bounty to anyone who will kill him (and his friends, who have done no wrong and who, more importantly, the prostitutes have no particular reason to even dislike).  Word gets around; the country swarms with would-be-assassins; and eventually the men are killed by an aging Clint Eastwood character; except that HE kills them in a way that demonstrates the futility of violence, or some such.  On the way we meet a variety of unpleasant characters who walk onto centre stage and then walk off, to pad things out.I'll be honest: I loathe Westerns as a rule, but I'm not incapable of recognising a good story that, for some reason or other, can be appropriately set in 19th-century America.  This bloated movie, if it's about anything at all, is about other Westerns.  "Look!" it cries.  "Other Westerns glorify violence!  Other Westerns are ignore the role of blacks! Other Westerns don't admit that prostitutes were mistreated!"  At least other Westerns were films in their own right.
