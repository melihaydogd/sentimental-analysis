watchable but overrated, also too long
The film was watchable and some parts were impressive. But overall i don't think it lived up to the hype. The special effects were top but too much of it was already shown in promotions, trailers or clips. The acting was not very believable it seemed a bit OTT (especially Jack Black). My views of the film could be skewed by the fact that there was lot of noise in the cinema by some young unruly children, who decided to talk all the way through the movie and cause general annoyance. Also the film is way too long some scenes were not necessary, the film could have done with better editing. It seems Peter Jackson was a little over indulgent. However it would be unfair to say this film was bad. It has some great action especially with the dinosaur chase. The best parts of the film were on the jungle island.
