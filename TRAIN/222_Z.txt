A lot of good almost as much bad
Don&#39;t get me wrong a lot of surprises and good writing have come out of this show and even some unexpected surprises nobody could have predicted. However, the biggest problem is I truly believe they make episodes much to slow to ever go past a 10th season, at this rate the girl playing summer will be in her 40&#39;s by the time shooting wraps; and Justin has already had his time in the sun. He&#39;s a brilliant voice actor but is already handling to much with his new show. Which is what made Seth Macfarlane&#39;s &#39;Family Guy&#39; crap out from exhaustion. I predict 2 more good seasons left to come before it turns into a parody of its former self. I believe there&#39;s not enough want and need to make this a show like South Park Which in only its first 2 seasons, has surpassed in writing quality and quantity which only gets better with age. I believe the best episodes have already shown or will be quick to pass and from this time on Rick And Morty will encounter to many problems to stay afloat here in the next few years.
