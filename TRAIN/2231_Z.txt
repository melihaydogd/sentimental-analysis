Well my wife liked it
My wife love this film, she thinks this relationship movie is great. I found it ok the first time, but second time its more soap operish. They do this big dance at the end of the summer for a bunch of campers, after both lead character live becomes messes big deal. The movie seem hopeless, and pointless. I might be wrong, but this movie will not age well.
