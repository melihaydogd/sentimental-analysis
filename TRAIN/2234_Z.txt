Supposed classic is actually rather dull
I was not alive in the seventies to see this movie the first time around. In 2002 when I did finally first watch part of it on video, I felt myself becoming more and more depressed about the world. The setting of the film, the pacing, the seemingly directionless progression of events, all seemed to leave a bitter, stale taste in my mouth. It was, in a way, fascinating to see Al Pacino at a much younger age than the movies I have always seen him in. And the dynamic of the crowd jeering during his scenes outside brought some energy to the film that began to interest me, but I turned it off, somewhere near three quarters of the way through the film, because frankly, it didn't entertain me enough. I still believe in Al Pacino as a great actor, but Dog Day Afternoon left me feeling as though I had wasted my time. My advice would be that you don't waste yours on it, despite rave reviews of so many self-important critics of the classics of movies.
