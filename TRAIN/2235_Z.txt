A Waste of Two Great Actors
I have no idea why everyone loves this movie so much. I found it underwhelming.And I'm not just talking about the camera-work either. That's the least of this movie's problems. Everything is just way too schizophrenic. Characters (and references to characters) just pop out of absolutely nowhere, only to then be dropped like a bad habit only minutes later. As such, the viewer is given nothing to work with in terms of dramatic tension, suspense, or well executed action. The comedy always feels forced because there's no setup time for any of the scenarios; they do this, then they immediately do something completely different, then they instantly do something else, etc. ad infinitum. The script can be summarized as follows: a bunch of stuff happens, very little of which is interesting or fun. It tries to be stylish but comes off as simply cheap. And no, it's not funny at all.This movie is the posterchild for underdeveloped concepts. Virtually everything here is wafer thin, as expected when you throw in dozens of superficial elements that are given a few minutes of screen time each. The structure and light-speed cadence is so irritating that it grates on the nerves within the opening 5 minutes. Someone should have given the director some depressants and taken away the cameraman's Red Bull.This was a huge disappointment, and a waste of two great actors.
