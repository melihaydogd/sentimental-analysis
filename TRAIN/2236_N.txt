Not too good, not too bad
I can't say I liked or disliked The Crow. The acting was good, but the story didn't appeal to me. I suppose the vendetta theme has been done so much that I have become tired of it. Also, sometimes it seemed the plot was hard to follow. It could have been a better movie, but it was just to simplistic.
