Bloody and violent old school action flick
OK, so I have to admit: I can&#39;t help but love Sly Stallone. The guy just keeps coming back succesfully, against all odds. Who would have thought that he could pull off another Rambo flick at age 73? Well, I&#39;m glad he did, because besides Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington and Mel Gibson, who are we gonna turn to for some old school, old-man-on-a-revenge-spree flick?<br/><br/>I was a big fan of First Blood, but didn&#39;t care so much for the second (too cartoonish) and third (too friggin&#39; awful) installments. The fourth however, was just amazing. A slow build up, a suspenseful breakout and then cathartic violence. That last action sequence, where Rambo goes totally berserk and makes minced meat out of a whole army, I mean, come on, that was awesome.<br/><br/>The fifth Rambo is a little different in that it is more of a generic revenge flick in its setup. But only in its setup though. As soon as Rambo starts maiming and killing, this movie goes so far over the top you can&#39;t help but cheer him on. This is one bloody movie. Last blood it may be, but it is many a full bucket of it.<br/><br/>I also like how Rambo is more vulnarable in this flick. Stallone gets to use more of his acting chops in this one.<br/><br/>I know it&#39;s a lot to ask, and maybe I shouldn&#39;t even hope for it, but damn it, I sure would like another one of these.
