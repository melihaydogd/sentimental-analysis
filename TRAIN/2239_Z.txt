A bit underwhelming really
Never having seen this film, it was always on my 'to see' list given the high accolades it receives.

Having decided to watch it on my own due to so called 'disturbing scenes' I sat down today to 'enjoy' the film.

The opening scene is the best. The stare Alex gives the camera as it pans out is a classic image, one which promises much mayhem and extreme behaviour from the lead character. Unfortunately, i never quite got what i was looking for.

I was hoping to be shocked and left with some kind of feeling after the film, but all I was left with was a 'was that it?'

There were elements I enjoyed, namely the music score, which reminded me of the music from The Warriors in an early synth kind of way.

I also enjoyed the glee with which Malcolm McDowell sang 'singing in the rain' while punctuating the parts of the song by slapping and kicking his victims. But it isn't as menacing as it sounds. I was always well aware I was watching actors, and never for a moment became absorbed into any of the characters. However I think it was meant to be received in this way, to add to the 'dystopian society that doesn't care' message, which I get, but that just doesn't make for a very enjoyable film, thats why I would recommend people to read the book if you're looking to become absorbed in the character and the true meaning of the story.

I can understand how in 1971 this was considered a very disturbing film, but do not judge it by todays standards else you will be underwhelmed.
