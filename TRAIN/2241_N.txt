Dirty is very apropriate
I'm not sure I'll ever understand why such a vapid, inane, and formulaic movie got so popular. I understand it has something to do with immature females who think this is quality romance. The dry sex to music is just annoying and the lead character is named Johnny Castle. For a real movie with real romance watch Casablanca.
