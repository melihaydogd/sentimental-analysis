I think i might be the minority on this one....
I don't feel like the movie lived up to the hype. I'm really stoked to hear that many thought it was good, I want nothing more than to see one of my favorite shows of all time be successful. If you are a true Simpsons fan, this movie left a lot to be desired. There were a few moments that were pretty awesome. Spiderpig = genius! But what the hell happened to him???? He just disappeared! The key secondary characters that have rounded the show out over the years were nearly non-existent. Hardly any Skinner, Moe, Barney, Ralph, Milhouse, etc. Why weren't they more involved? The plot and storyline was pretty random, didn't make sense, and for lack of a better word was "eh". The President should have been McBain. Could have fit with the show a little better. One of the main characters in the movie (the dude that had Hank Scorpios voice, Secretary of State maybe?) was NEVER featured in the show. I just feel like they should have stuck to the plot lines that brought them to the success of seasons 2-9ish. Maybe bring back Conan?
