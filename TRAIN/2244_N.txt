Men with big hats
I confess I have not seen much of the series but the bits I have seen do not lead me to watch it. It has the flavour of Dallas about it. As for some calling it a 'western' apart from men in big hats it is nothing like a real western. Then Dallas was nothing to do with oil! I hope the actual West is nothing like this!
