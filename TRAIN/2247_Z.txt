Okish but really slow moving
With the cast they had and the concept, I expected it to be more funny and fun, yet it lingered on and took a long time to get off the ground. Great visuals and animation, lacking in excitement and ultimately coming to a head in seemingly the last 30 minutes with some excitement and laughs.
