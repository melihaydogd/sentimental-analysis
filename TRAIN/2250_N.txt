Not That Funny! 2/10
Review: This movie is full of stupid jokes that aren't really that funny. Marlon Wayans makes a right fool out of himself throughout the movie, alongside his wife, who is played by Essence Atkins and Cedric The Entertainer. I knew what to expect before watching the movie, so I wasn't that surprised with the outcome. There was a couple of scenes that made me chuckle, but it's not a movie that I would be watching again in a hurry. On the plus side, it not that long so you will be put out of your misery before you fall asleep. Disappointing!

Round-Up: In true Scary Movie fashion, this movie is full of references to other movies but it based around the original Paranormal Activity, but not done that well. You really have to have a warped sense of humour to find these movies funny or even slightly interesting. In its favour, the movie doesn't look cheap the CGI was half decent, but that about it. I just hope that they put a end to these ridiculous spoofs. With the profit that this movie has made, I'm sure that there is more to come

Budget: $2.5million Worldwide Gross: $40million

I recommend this movie to people who,are into the Scary Movie franchise. 2/10
