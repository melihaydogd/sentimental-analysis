Rated Too High
This is a generic predictable I used to be a hitman action flick. This is not John Wick or The Equalizer, far from it in fact. I feel like the trailer was better than the flick, which really had me wanting to see it.

The pacing is really off, things happen way too quickly and feel out of place at times. Things just randomly happen with no build up. Not much emotion is shown in the film. Things come way top easy for the good guys, everyone feels safe with no real threat around any corner. The villain is not anything to write home about.

Love Better Call Saul and action films but this one is overrated on IMDB. Check your expectations at the door.
