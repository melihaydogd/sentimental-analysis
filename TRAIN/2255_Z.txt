Preachy, predictable, slow pace.
I am surprised at the praise this movie gets.  The characters are all one dimensional.  The lawyers at Tom Hanks' firm are all evil bigots, Tom Hanks plays the most brilliant and kind lawyer in the world, his gay friends are kind and supportive, every member of his family is kind and loving and supportive. Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends.  I could not buy any of these characters as real life people.   They were all caricatures.<br/
