No amount of coffee will save you from this snoozer!
I didn't expect much from this movie, and thank goodness I didn't, because this movie fell completely flat. There was no real plot to the story. Was it about trying to save The Washington Post? Was it about the Pentagon Papers? Nixon? Freedom of Press? I guess we'll never know. I don't know which is sadder; all those themes and it lacked any luster, dimension, and depth, or the big actors that didn't bring anything to the film. Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep acted like they were bored and doing this for a paycheck. This was the only thing I could really feel in this movie. And this is supposed to be Oscar worthy? Did I miss something? Are the Oscar's the new Razzies?
