Gravity is one of these rare movies I thought there must be a 2nd version out there in cinema. A version which is visually that impactful, tense and simply that amazing everybody keeps saying. But no, it's not. There's no OMG at any point of the endless floating and heavy breathing. no thrill nothing memorable for me... just a black sea of nothing. I guess I'll take my beloved one and a picknick blanket and make myself comfortable under the actual sky.
