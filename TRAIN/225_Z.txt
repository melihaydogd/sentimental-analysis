It wasn't that bad. It was charming in a weird, weird way. Sure, the cat effects were jarring, sure it was a little surreal bit of uncanny valley. But once you embrace that, it's funny! It's fun! It's campy! The story wasn't perfect but honestly, I had a good time watching it. There were parts that were unsettling to look at, very uncomfortable and had me saying "is this really happening right now?" And it was, oh believe me it was. But as long as you don't take it seriously, it's kinda cute. Like seeing an animal so ugly, it starts to look cute.

It's not great, no no no. No, it's silly looking but I would... dare I say, watch it again.
