Funny, but...
I thought this movie was really well done and quite funny BUT why in the world do they have to have so much casual profanity? The name of Jesus is thrown around like a teen age girl uses exclamation marks in a note to her girl-friend. It is somewhat in character but it isn't really necessary. Who wrote this anyway? They certainly are "enlightened" and free of the "inhibitions" that plague those of us who live normal lives. I like Alan Arkin (he was great in The Russians are Coming) and I like Peter Falk as well. I think they could have been just as funny without taking the name of the Lord in vain. It would be nice if God and Jesus got the same respect as some of the earth bound gods.
