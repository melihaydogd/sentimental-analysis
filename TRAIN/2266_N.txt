Don't waste your time on this one.
I haven't seen this movie in many years and "perhaps" I should watch it again...BUT I remember trying to get through it the first time was sheer torture. I kept waiting for ANYTHING to happen. You know how you will stick with a movie ten minutes at a time after the first half you think, "It's got to get better". Not this one. It was the most boring piece of crap I have EVER seen. One of these days, maybe...when I'm in a vegetative state and nobody is around to change the channel, I'll watch it again. NOT!!!!!!!!!!!  For some reason the hamsters here think that it requires some long drawn out critique of a movie for us to express ourselves. Unlike "professional" movie critics who blow smoke and pat each other on the back praising their pseudo-intellect. We can actually say whether we like or dislike a movie in a few succinct sentences. So, hopefully my entry is long enough now. It's a shame isn't it?
