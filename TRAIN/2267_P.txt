Intolerant Homosexuals
At the time of writing 1000 frothing gay activists, most who have not even seen the film have rated this piece a 1. Even if you don't like the premise this is an impossible task for any narrative which has reason and decent production values.

Therefore once again the homosexual community lies, just like a short decade ago when they were trying to tell us one third of the population was gay, census info told us that was horseshit too.

Wake up and smell the roses, you are intolerant of any views outside of your own, you say love is important but you can't dialogue with anyone that wants to keep the original definition of marriage. Newsflash you don't need the State to affirm the love you already share.

Ya'll wanted acceptance, I was happy to give it but its moments like this that have resulted in the opposite, you will never have peace while you think your whole identity revolves around your sexuality.
