I literally fell asleep after 10 minutes
After seeing harry potter 6 in theaters i decided with my friend to go and see this movie. I really didn't have a clue what it was about i just went cause it was 3-D. So i expected a pretty good movie cause it was Disney it was in 3-D But after 10 minutes of a dumb plot this film falls under the bottom of terrible movies I've seen. The story couldn't be any more foolish. A guy is gonna take over the world and 3 guinea pigs yeah i know have to stop him. That story has always been used in movies and it never comes out good. The movie wasn't funny at all, The characters are mediocre, and the action scenes put me to sleep. Overall this movie was a waste of minutes and me and my friend left the theater and i felt like throwing the glasses at the screen. Do yourself a favor or to your families and go see something better the audience hardly laughed only a few chuckles. 1 Out of 10 for Razzie Picyure of the year.
