Heartbreaking waste of talent
2/10 for the best efforts of Sigorney Weaver and Gene Hackman in this waste of time comedy wanna-be. Ms. Weaver does her best to bolster a stupid story and a poor script. Hackman manages to walk through most of the film and still give it some credibility.

Typical sight gags can not save this poorly written and directed film about a mother and daughter whore team. Out to whoo rich men and then grab huge divorce settlements or death benefits is so 1960's. It would have been somewhat more comic if it were a father-son team (although less politically correct, I suppose - we have too many buddy films already).

Jenifier Love Hewitt is a pleasure to watch. Her skin tight outfits are almost worth the admission or rental fee. That's it. She has minimal acting or comic ability. "Walk-ons" by Anne Bancroft and Ray Liotta were another waste of talent.
