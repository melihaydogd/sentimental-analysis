Just skip this trash
This is a bad movie. Do not try to find out any hidden meaning in this piece of trash because there is nothing. There is no plot, no thought, no idea in this horrible thing. Only thing you may like is a nude Scarlett Johansson in many scenes. I was wondering is she the same lady who gave us a powerhouse performance in Marriage Story or did a heart winning job in Jojo Rabbit. Maybe the Avengers years made her lose her sanity. So one piece of advice- avoid this and save your valuable time.
