The adage is true
There is an adage that has become popular over the past decade. The adage goes:

"If your comic book/superhero movie is hitting the theaters in a month other than May, June or July then it's more than likely because the movie sucks and would get killed during the summer movie season"

"Watchmen" is the latest comic book movie that proves this to be true.

The movie, which has an interesting beginning, somehow manages to drift off in too many different directions via short stories about the central characters that have nothing to do with the main plot of the film. The overall result, with the exception of the rare fight sequence, is a film that is way too long and extremely boring. Over half of the audience in a sold out showing that I went too walked out within the first 45-75 minutes. I found myself checking my watch constantly wondering how much longer would it be before this film went anywhere. Then I was checking it wondering when it would finally end. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the comic/graphic novel you will more than likely will not like this film and should avoid this almost three hour snooze fest at all costs.
