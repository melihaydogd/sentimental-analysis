Don't expect another slobberingly postive review. This STINKS!
Yes, the photography is excellent, but come on, how many movies have lousy photography? This is a film with such long pauses and such ham-fisted staging that I keep thinking one of the actors will break and ask, "line?" Ry Cooder, as usual, seems to be composing for another movie entirely, as his twangs and plucks do nothing but annoy. And who can abide the Euromorality of the film (meaning "none"), wherein the least qualified person to take care of the child in any capacity is the one the film makers deem the only one do to the job. In certain cultures, rotten eggs buried for months are considered a delicacy, and if you enjoy such sulphurous tastes, eat hearty, for Paris, Texas serves a generous portion. If any film stock deserved to be recycled, it is the film stock for this. Truly detestable.
