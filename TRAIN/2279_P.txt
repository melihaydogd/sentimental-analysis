I'm running out of heroes, guys like you are in short supply.
'The Insider' is as stylish as it is thought-provoking. Based on real-life events makes the film timeless, but more, the overall message the movie carries beneath its devastating true story makes the film even more poignant today - the era where corporate greed has grown, and manipulation with media is so out of hands that they barely try to hide it anymore. Michael Mann uses magnificently his trademark action film aesthetics to bring this deep humane crime drama on to the screen. Stylish editing, novel camera movements and slow-motion don't draw any attention from the story, but it enhances the fear that the characters are going through. The visual style adds just another layer of intensity to already a suspenseful story and wonderful acting works. Three hours pass quickly and the viewers are kept on the edge of their seats while the story progresses.

Magnificent and thrilling drama. Unfortunately, this sort of true-life dramas on epic proportions is a thing from the past.
