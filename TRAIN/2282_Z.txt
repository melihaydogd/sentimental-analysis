I'm a huge Arch Hall Jr. fan, but this was honestly kind of lame.
Sorry, but an unfunny comedy is an unfunny comedy, even if it has one of my favorite actors in it. Still, even the best actors have their weaker films, and Hall is certainly one of the best. It would normally score a 2, but I'm doubling that because of Hall.
