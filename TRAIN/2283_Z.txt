Completely fictional account

The film is a completely fictional non-historical film set in a 15th century England and France. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film is how they make Henry V "woke" with a ludicrous ending. Interjecting current fashionable sensibilities into historical films is a crime against both art and history. As far as a fictional movie goes, it's OK, with great set design, wardrobe and a tremendous battle scene but the lack of respect for the subject matter makes me unable to rate this film any higher than a woke 4/10.
