This movie showed a bit funny story about robbers with awkward laughing.
Most things usually don't go well. It's just common. So I saw that when you plan something, it was very important to have these abilities, collecting information/having flexible thinking/selection members.

I felt like a bit annoying with Al Pacino's speech cockily. In the last half, I saw that his environment was bad because most people arouod him wouldn't hear his words. It was easier to push my own opinion to someone. If people around me would be so, I must claim that listen to me even for 2 minutes! ( It's just a lyric of Japanese popular song lol.) The environment kills someone.
