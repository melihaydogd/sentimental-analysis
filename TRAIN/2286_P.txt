Excellent film by Peter Jackson, director of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy!
This film is a masterpiece! I also expected nothing less from this film. I knew the film was very expensive and that Peter Jackson was the director. Peter Jackson also directed the excellent Lord Of The Rings trilogy. This is a very long film (it takes exactly 3 hours), in the beginning the pace is quite slow. Some people may even get bored for a while. For me the pace was also sometimes a bit too slow, but that wasn't really disturbing. The direction of this film was excellent. There were many excellent and beautiful scenes. The cinematography and the special effects were excellent! King Kong, the ape looks pretty real. His face also shows emotions, that was really nice! The acting was O.K. Naomi Watts did an excellent job, also the rest of the cast did O.K. Also the music (by James Newton Howard) has to be mentioned, it's sometimes really beautiful. This is an excellent film that everyone should try to see as soon as possible! The film has a lot of action in it, beautiful cinematography and music and is also very emotional, especially at the end. Peter Jackson is, since he made The Lord Of The Rings trilogy one of my favorite directors!
