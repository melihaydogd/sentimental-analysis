What was that???
Considering that this movie went all the way up the IMDb top list, i was totally excited about it. But, just as expected, it was not worth the hype. In fact it wasn&#39;t close to the hype. I wasn&#39;t nearly as fun as some of the other movies like toy story or finding nemo. It wasn&#39;t close to funny. Sure there were good moments, but not as much as you would expect for such a long movie. I guess you have to think how funny can a rat who cooks be. This was a total disappointment after great movies like happy feet, Madagascar, cars, etc. I mean what the hell was this?? Who came up with this brilliant idea?? I just hope the directors have better things to do than waste time on crappy movies like this one. And who are all these ppl who love the movies?? Really?? is it really one for the books?? It was at best mediocre. Nothing more than that. I would recommend watching it once, at home, when it comes out on DVD and be glad you saved ur money...
