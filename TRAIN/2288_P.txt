The best film I've seen in years: indescribable!
I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending, unbelievably-acted &#39;movie&#39; for the rest of my days. I&#39;m just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I&#39;ll go so far as to say that if you don&#39;t cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don&#39;t have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I&#39;ve ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can&#39;t describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I&#39;ve seen in years. :&#39;)
