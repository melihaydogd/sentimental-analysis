Manages to be both pretentious and uninteresting
Another reviewer described this film as sophomoric, and I would have to concur. Like the recent screen adaptation of Kerouac's On The Road, this movie makes excessive behaviors of youth look as dreary, sad, and unappealing as in retrospect they are. 

There's very little nuance here. Figures of the 'Establishment' are presented as little more than caricatures, and most of the artsy folk in opposition to them too full of self importance and excess to evoke sympathy. 

The only truly enjoyable aspect of this film, for me anyway, is Dane DeHaan's performance (warranting the three stars I gave up). This young actor has a sort of incandescent magnetism that commands your attention and eclipses everything and everyone else on the screen. Ben Foster is always interesting to watch as well, but Daniel Radcliffe--reasonably competent as a boy wizard--suffers in comparison to these greater talents in the central role of Ginsburg.
