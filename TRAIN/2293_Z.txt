All ingredients are there for a good movie but the story is lame.
Like someone said before, or you love this movie or you won't think much of it. You can categorize me with the second option, I didn't think much of it and could not wait for this movie to be over. I've just been lured by the names of the cast. Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine are both actors I really like and even in this movie they do a good job with their acting performances. The filming techniques are also excellent, nothing bad to say about that. The nature scenery from Switzerland are also nice to look at. So why would I rate Youth below average? Because when I watch a movie I need to be entertained, the movie has to have an interesting story, a story well told. And even for drama's that are not necessary my thing the story has to be interesting, and sometimes it is. But with Youth I didn't get anything of that. It's a long boring story about basically nothing. Too bad because you had all the right ingredients to make it a good movie. But without a decent story you can't have a good movie.
