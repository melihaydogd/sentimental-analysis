Not good.
After saw this movie i think about other film Blade Runner .Blade Runner Is Masterpiece Best Movie About Artificial Intelligence . In Blade Runner You Can See What Is Consequences If Human Make A Robot We See Everything & Feel Everything .Like Hope,Freedom,Evolution, Obviously The Final Scene Of Blade Runner Is Remarkable. But Ex Machina Can,t Say Anything It,s Completely Backward . If Blade Runner is 9 Ex Machina Is 1 . Of Curse I Think 1 Is Very Good For This Film & I Can,t Believe What Movies Going To Oscar To Name Of Best Picture Every Year Academy Work Worst . This Movie Don,t Have Any Acting , Directing,Writing,Cinematography,Score & Any New Idea, So What Is That? In 2001 We Saw Artificial Intelligence The Movie Can Say Something , We Can See The Little David Have Hope To see Her Mother ,HOPE, He Wish To Be Real Human ,WISH, And... But Ex Machina Is Really Have Nothing To Say Nothing.
