Brilliant story failed by jumbled direction and an ordinary lead
While watching this movie, I caught myself wishing I was reading the book instead. Surely this was an adaptation from a well-constructed thriller, with interesting characters, neat plot twists and insight into workplaces that indicates deep research.

There was no book. There are at least three ridiculous leaps to move the story arc along, where a less confusing connection would have sufficed. Those gaping plot holes unfortunately ruined something that could have been a gem.

Lastly, Ben Affleck is inconsistent in the lead role. He is not the reason the movie fails, but is certainly miscast. While in a few scenes he seems to have the tics and dispassion his character requires, in others he makes too much eye contact or speech modulation. Imagine someone like Edward Norton nailing this role.
