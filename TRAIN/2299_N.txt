The most overrated animation of all time!
I can define "Up" as the stolen 90 minutes of my life. Actually,I had really high expectations about Up, before watching it. However, it was so bad, i barely finished the movie. I can say that the main characters are well created and written. On the other hand, there was no story in the movie. Except the little clip that tells the Carl's life in the beginning, there was nothing good and original thing in the movie. It was full of the clich√© dialogues and cheesy jokes. Also the side characters were weak and poor. they had nothing to add to the story. However, i have to give it that clip i mentioned earlier was really awesome. I wish that the movie would be about Ellie and Carl trying make their dreams come true together.
