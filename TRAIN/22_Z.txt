Great hope, great disappointment
The imagination is rich, but the plot is too thin. It's kind of fascinating at first, but the second half is naive. I feel that the director and the screenwriter want to create works as good as Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, but they are not good enough. The film becomes mediocre and naive.
