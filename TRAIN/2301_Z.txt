It's FINE
Honestly I dont get the hate for this film. It was fine. Not amazing, certainly not terrible. Two weeks after release I sat in a sold out cinema with an entertained audience a lot of whom cried at appropriate moments. Yes it's weird, and at times boring because the songs just keep bleeding into each other, but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kids will like. Not nearly as bad as people have been saying. The Mr Mestophalies scene and the scene where she sings memory are the two best scenes. You cant fault the dancing performers or most of the singing the sets and vfx are solid for the most part and it's actually really impressive technically. It's fine.
