Outstanding 3D and generally funny!!
I took my girlfriend to see this film as she loves guinea pigs and i have to be honest i wasn't expecting much from it.But I couldn't of been more surprised when i actually saw it. This film doesn't get boring for one second from start to finish. The 3D effects were nothing short of brilliant and the guinea pigs although animated looked completely real. I thought it was funny and thought the cast did a great job with the voices. I really hope people do go and see this one while they can as it would be a shame not to get a sequel made just because of so many people giving it bad review who clearly can't of seen this film as it is no where near as bad as the first few reviews make it out to be. It is generally funny and fast paced and worth watching for any age!
