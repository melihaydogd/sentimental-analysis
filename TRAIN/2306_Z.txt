A more positive view
I consider Dirty Dancing to be in the top 5 films of the 1980s. I don't agree with its politics, but I tip my hat to its honesty and artistry. It is a story of its time. Top Gun may have been more intense, from the male view, but both films connect to the soul in the same way. Jennifer Grey and Meg Ryan, as women, make profound connections in the two films. It matters not that they are so different. Different is what makes the connections so comfortable. It is a complete pleasure viewing Dirty Dancer and looking forward to watching Top Gun. Beautiful stories, beautiful women, set around the most beautiful photography ever. All that said, it doesn't even break my top 50. Mike
