Boring stupid turd of a movie
A computer system, named Eagle Eye, decides to do some things that involve recruiting 2 seemingly ordinary people. Car chases, shoot outs, jumps off tall buildings, more chases, tough nosed FBI agents etc etc.

Look I can handle suspension of disbelief but this movie is both boring and stupid. The main tension you get when watching this movie is wondering if there are actually going to be any interesting plot twists or ideas explored or will they stand on the train tracks and let the train run over them.

1. They have a computer system that can control things...great...why not put some limits on that system, I mean they did that in Die Hard 4 (and that is a movie where Bruce Willis shot down a helicopter with a car).

2. Was the computer right or wrong. That was the only possible interesting part of the movie. But they just ignored the whole thing. The computer represents the legal system of the united states, which invokes the whole idea of Magna Carta and the fact that they king is not above the law, but that is ignored.

Anyway ignore this movie unless you are really bored.
