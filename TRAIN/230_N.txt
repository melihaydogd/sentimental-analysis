Athiest Propaganda,Lazy writing at it's finest
I thought I was watching an adult show, and ended up watching something that directly reminded me of Beavis &amp; Butthead. The constant burping of Rick may be fun for a 10-yer old, but to me it&#39;s annoying from the start. I could have get past that, but tbh the show isn&#39;t even funny. Easy pass on this &quot;9,2&quot; show that I can&#39;t understand how it got those ratings (remember Friends has only an 8,9 rating, and is a billion times more fun and brilliant than this).
