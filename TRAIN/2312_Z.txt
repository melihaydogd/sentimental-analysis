Bit cheesy but okay!

Same as Ewok. Main draw for me was Norwich, as that's my home town! That was the first bit that annoyed me, was that it looked nothing like Norwich castle at all, Norwich was a fair size in late 1300. (For places back then) I don't mind a bit of adapting for a film but atleast try and get it a bit close. Same with language, reading a menu in a diner? What?! Okay, so if you can grit your teeth and just watch it, it's not bad. It's a cheesy nice little film, These Christmas movies are meant to be bad, and that makes them good to watch! :) just enjoy it for what it is, and don't expect too much!
