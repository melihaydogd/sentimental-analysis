Pretty Good!
I was a bit apprehensive about watching this movie considering that the current RottenTomatoes score is a dismal 23%. So much for the critics.

Story-line is pretty weak, but I guess that's all could be done if you wanted to stick to the video game format.

Some good casting choices, some bad... Aaron, M Keaton, Rami, Dominic, Ramon did it for me, Imogen, Dakota, Harrison, Scott (he was so irritating - African-Americans should protest the stereotyping) did not. Couldn't understand how Imogen's character went from savvy biz to dreamy ditz.

Elements of the game like the build-up to the final race, police car chases, attempted roadblock (the police car-pile driver was really a low-point), helicopter surveillance, etc were featured.

The movie was engrossing and I didn't feel the length of the two hours. However, some major plot holes/ inconsistencies didn't work for me... but hey, its based on a video game. I appreciate the director for not resorting to the F&F style of direction.

Watch it if you like cars, chases and/or Aaron... Would have liked him to say "Bitch" at least once! :) But can't have everything.
