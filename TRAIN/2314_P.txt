Finally A Streaming Service Knows How To Produce In 4K
I love The Expanse from the beginning but Amazon Prime taken Season 5 to another level in their own studio. I did not think the directing was very good in episode 1 but that changed, & the continuation of the story is excellent. The CG is awesome. I am so happy Prime pick this show up. It will be the best series ever.
