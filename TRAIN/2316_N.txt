Meh on top of meh.
As I watched it, I literally thought to myself "this is corny". A very pointless movie about people going from one location to another. Missing every reasonable element to comprise a decent zombie flick. End of the day, it's watchable, but it definitely should have gone straight to Netflix...or maybe the SciFy channel. Characters were meh, zombies were meh, even Rosario Dawson was meh....and I heard the budget was doubled. If you're going to see it, just cut your expectations in half before you go in.
