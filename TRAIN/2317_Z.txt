How does an informative movie like this accidentally leave out something so important?
The movie has excellent acting, flow, and is definitely worth a watch.

My biggest problem with this film is simple: there's almost zero mention of the government causing the housing market problem by pushing lenders to give out more loans to minorities, immigrants, and anyone else that statistically can't afford them.

The movie loves to blame the "evil bankers" when in reality, it was the evil and incompetent government that not only forced the banks to do it, who were definitely willing, but played an active role in making sure it continued.

I'm not sure if the Federal Reserve is mentioned even a single time. How is that possible in a movie about the housing market bubble? All of the newly created money (loans) comes straight from the Fed.
