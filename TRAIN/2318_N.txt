Over-rated
First the good. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Finnes are both terrific. The stars are for them. They are two enormously talented actors. However, the material meanders. It's very much a run of the mill BBC pot boiler of the kind that Miramax trotted out twice a month in the early '90s, with very little to get you excited. The creatives seemed to have picked that up halfway through the script, so they added a completely inconsequential love triangle amongst the co-stars and saddled poor Lily James with some terrible situations and silly dialogue. Ben Chaplin and Lily James picking out sleeping arrangements sent me to the fridge for sustenance to bare me through the last 45 minutes. The stakes of the find at the center of the "action" are that Anglo Saxon civilization had attained cultural heights in Ipswich much earlier than previously known. That seems to be totally irrelevant to the protagonists. Moments of consequence, generally when Carey's characters take on the cultural establishment, mostly happen off screen. (Ran out of money? Ended up on the cutting room floor?) If the characters, the writers and the director don't care about the stakes, why should I?
