Couldn't Get Through It (Several Times)
Pitt being my favorite actor, I've tried my best to watch this movie. But I could not get myself to do it. It's got thriller in it, and a romance with that famous French actress that guts Bman at the end of Dark Knight Rises. But come on. I need some more action and story then what they're offering.

Spy thrillers should be dark and cold. This one seems to constantly trying to hide the fact that they're lead actor is aging. And knowledgeably.

Not worth my time.
