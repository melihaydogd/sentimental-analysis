No,No,No
It was almost impossible to make a film with a end as lame as Reloaded but congratulations they have. The end doesn't conclude everything it just shows that the Wachoswki brother really only care about the money. If the ending had been good then perhaps it would have made a worthy sequel. The last fight scene is very good. The Matrix trilogy shouldnt have existed It should have been just the first one.

Everything that has a beginning has an end. Everything that has a beginning doesn't have a very good end
