Miraculous masterpiece: great
Several years ago I may have read the original story, but don't remember it; and it doesn't matter. The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.

Everything about Blade Runner is absolutely fabulous. It soars where the clunky and semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles.

Now that I've read the book, and watched "Dangerous Days", I learn that Tyrell, the supposed creator, was merely another replicant, which simply confirms what I already believed.

The performances are nonpareil. The girl playing Rachael (funny spelling) is perfection itself. But all the players are flawless, anyway. The vision is transcendental, matchless. A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning.
