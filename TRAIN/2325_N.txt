"Woke" Movie About The Invisible Man's Girlfriend
This version of "The Invisible Man" is filmed in Sydney, Australia but is supposed to take place in San Francisco. That explains why most of the action takes place in building interiors, dark streets and parking lots. The villain is a rich white guy. There is a black guy, a cop, but he mostly stands around like a potted plant, acting as if he forgot his lines. The rich guy's girlfriend is the star of the movie and her cardboard role is played listlessly by Elizabeth Moss, an actress who needs a good director and a better script. Along the way, there are some fight scenes involving a visible person and the invisible man. The fights look like amateur night. There are about 30 seconds total of invisibility visual effects and they are miserably done and repeated. It looks like most of the film's budget was spent on salaries for the producers. The movie's director seems to be a big fan of Terminator 2, he borrowed everything he could from that James Cameron movie. Except Cameron's talent.
