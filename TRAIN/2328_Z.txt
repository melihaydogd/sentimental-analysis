The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies
The death of Smaug in the first ten minutes destroyed the film for me, and I did not care much about the events because in the previous part they showed Smaug as an invincible being, but he died in one blow, and in the first ten minutes of the film the fighting scenes in the film were great. The romance in the film was not good. Sauron with Gandalf was hugely awesome
