Well, that's in the seventies
The movie started out nice enough, sparking adequate curiosity. It also gets interesting as the robbery takes place. But then the movie falls to become stupid by today's standards. No scope on the snipers' rifles, the crowd being too close to the scene, the police officers are too reckless, there's no negotiator at hand, and the list goes on. What becomes even more stupid is the fact that Sonny easily waltz in and out of the crime scene again and again. Well, I think that would look normal since it happened in the seventies, when police procedures haven't got any set standards yet. It gets more stupid as the story ends just like that, whereas it took the police and the FBI the whole day to do it. The acting overall surely highlight Al Pacino's great and convincing acting work. It's too bad that he hasn't smoke that much yet thus his signature voice wasn't there yet.
