Starts with a bang .....
......... then becomes a pandiculation! (yawn)

McConaughey as Ron Woodroof at the beginning of the movie is highly polished and very entertaining because the viewer really wants to hate this despicable person. Then when he crosses the border as a priest that is where the movie begins to fall apart.

We are shown a man who's only interest is booze, women, sex, and gambling. Nowhere are we given a lead into this characters ability to think creatively and to be so studious and capable of intensive research! That is not to say that didn't actually happen! But McConaughey pulls this rabbit out of his hat to fast and slick. There's no evidence that this character has this temperament and I just couldn't believe it.

But all isn't lost because the true shining actor is Jared Leto as Rayon! Rayon saves this movie then quietly slips away! Leto is outstanding as Rayon I hope he get a lot more recognition for his performance because McConaughey as a whole was a bore!
