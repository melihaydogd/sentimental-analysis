Major Disappointment
Worst movie ever? Probably not. But certainly in the bottom 2 percent of my experience.I was very excited to see this film having read some favorable reviews..."very nuanced", "a new form of sci-fi", "cool soundtrack"...and all that. And I think Scarlett is often very good, sometimes great.But, boy, what a let-down.From the opening sequence thru the end, it is a pedantic slog. It is the SLOWEST-paced, I-think-I-am-a-super-arty-filmographer, waste-of-time I (and my wife) have seen in a long time. It reminded me of the worst 1960s movies (grating soundtrack with arbitrary and bizarre screen shots). A HUGE disappointment. Sure, there are a couple cool concepts (black goo sucking down guys for their skins), and atmospheric urban and rural views of Scotland...and, of course, Scarlett in the all-together (or a very decent CGI rendition thereof), but otherwise...really not worth the time. (Sorry Scarlett!)There is: no character development; almost no dialogue; bizarre muzak; incredibly-SLOW, self-important, pandering filmography; and an overwhelming desire to be art-house-cool...but that's about it.But at least it is EXTREMELY SLOW....did I mention that?If that is your cup of tea, then enjoy! But if not...Save your time and your money for something better....which is very easily done.
