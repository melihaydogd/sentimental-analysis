Decent exploitation film almost has the right parts.
How could any nut forget GAS PUMP GIRLS? This one possibly started the light "exploitation comedies" that flowed into the early 80s mainstream. It appears that all the dirty filth invading theater screens since then suddenly gave way to this picture that PORKY'S would later follow. You'll most likely expect the home video version being drastically cut of any excessive garbage, but what's the difference? Don't be surprised to find this one fairly delightful, very amusing, and less profane, because that's the way films like this should be. Still "adults only" fun, but not at the extreme (unless an uncut edition surfaces!). I hate how movies like this offer a plot where "getting revenge" hampers an already sweet story of five young girls running shop, so that kind of hurts it. If you're addicted to shot-on-video porn (and I hope not!), this isn't for you. But I know you're honest! GAS PUMP GIRLS, while worth a good night's rent, is a surprisingly overlooked gem that needed greater attention. A fine reference of cult moviedom. Check out the video box cover and see for yourself!
