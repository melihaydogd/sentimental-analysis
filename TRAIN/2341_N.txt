what a load
I know everyone has seen this thing by now so it's not like I'm saying anything really new. Star Wars is one of the worst movies I had seen up until the time it came out. (I was there the first time ... definitely not impressed.) The special effects were poor even for the nineteen seventies.I mean the small models used for the fighter planes (spaceships?) are obvious. The hulls look as if they were made out of brick not metal. Of course there are no explosions in outer space but why let basic facts interfere with a (bad) story. . And what is an aristocracy doing in a society advanced enough for space travel? That arrogant princess should have been the first one to be zapped.
