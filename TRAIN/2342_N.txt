This dog of a movie should be buried fathoms deep
The history and actual discovery is fascinating. I had no idea I was going to be subjected to two hours of navel gazing atheism. Bleak and depressing and every other scene are miserable people moving and talking slowly. I suggest everyone skip this film and go look up the history of sutton hoo instead. A mawkish mess with zero thrills. No humor, no energy, and as dead as the Anglo Saxon king's remains.
