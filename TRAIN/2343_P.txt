Filmed local to me and really enjoy the show.
I live in Darby, MT where most of this is filmed - just yesterday they filmed right across the street from me in a field with a few horse and cattle. I believe the show is pretty solid story, and in the niche where Costner does his best. One thing I did notice about the first season, given my half Native American side, is it leaves you wondering who the good guys and bad guys are - perhaps both sides are both good and bad.

I will admit it is neat to see them filming while here, the ranch is just down the road from me and I pass nearly daily on the way to fish in the Bitterroot River
