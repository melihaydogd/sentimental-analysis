just another crazy stalker movie
So I saw the trailer and was a bit excited because it had Nia Long, Stephen Bishop and Omar Epps... then I watched about 30minutes and just thought why did they agree to this script? the movie is wayyyyy below their pay grade and you can already figure out what's going to happen next in the scenes. It reminded me of the movie the perfect guy..right down to the promo picture. waste of time and great actors...not recommending it to anyone sorry.
