A murky 'thriller'
This Scottish thriller was described as the British 'se7en' but sadly I didn't see much of that American film's style in this rather poor effort.

The plot involves Journalist Dunbar trying to find his adopted daughter before she is killed by a paedophile gang. The locations are suitably seedy and noirish but sadly the film is let down by a rather difficult-to-follow plot and some erratic acting.

In fact the most interesting thing about this film is the casting. The director David Hayman takes a major role as Dunbar's editor at the paper and manages to shout all his lines with suitable malice. Andy Serkis also pops up as a transvestite believe it or not! He seems to be doing his Gollum voice throughout!

The gorgeous Julie Graham is sadly wasted as Dunbar's ex-wife however and barely has much to do apart from take her clothes off in a surprisingly erotic scene.

This film really is a missed opportunity for all involved and far too labyrinthine in plot. The characters are underdeveloped and some of the acting is abysmal. And to be honest - any film that wastes Julie Graham's talent doesn't deserve success!

Avoid this below-average and tedious thriller...
