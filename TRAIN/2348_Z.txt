Some good, some bad, but it wasn't G.IJoe
I was generally disappointed with this movie, and I did give it a fair chance.

Rather than be GI Joe, the team should instead be called the Minori-team. They aren't real American heroes because most of them aren't American, hell, their base isn't even in America, it's in Egypt with the stereotypical camel guy stalking around it's entrance. The whole franchise had been based off of, "GI Joe, the Real American Heroes".

This movie at times actually seemed more like a spoof of the old TV show than it was an action movie relaunch of the franchise. It reminds me of the P.O.S. Trek Trek 'relaunch' they did a bit ago. Why do they even bother? They actually did a cool and creative thing with Cobra Commander, though. He turns out to be who everyone thinks is Dr. Mindbender, but is in reality someone else. He's been horribly disfigured by a bunker explosion he and the not-so-good Dr. were in together, but they never do say what happened to the real Mindbender. He's on a respirator device like Darth Vader and later reveals he's wearing a wig. Sadly they then screw this up at the end of the movie by making him put on a ridiculous looking mask that makes him sound like a white guy trying to be James Earl Jones doing Darth Vader on a bad day.

Yeah, apparently the spoof for this movie was already made by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, it's called 'Team America'. You're better off watching that as it was much more entertaining with far better writing. Kim Jong Il's performance in that movie was absolutely breathtaking. As for GI Joe, the Rea... er... GI Joe, the International Minoriteam, wait until it comes on TV, not even worth renting IMO.
