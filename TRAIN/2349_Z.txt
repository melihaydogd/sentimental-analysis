Solid movie, but based on religious backstory
The movie is well built and has a few exceptional moments. But it is fully (or as much as possible) understandable only in a certain key. And that key is religious, or rather spiritual. It belongs to a certain view over the world, and makes me consider how much some people believe that is the only correct view. I think it is called gnosticism. In its light the movie depicts life itself, transdimensional that is. The human existence on Earth is a punishment, a form of demotion for the spirits that inhabit the human bodies, and the "angels" are here to protect the rules by which these punished spirits in human bodies have to live. There is not much kindness or fairness in this existence, unless some individual way of transcending it cuts through the harsh rules. Aside this rather severe framework of things, the story may be captivating, perhaps more for down to earth people than for dreamers. It is a milestone movie, so better watch it for a personal opinion. My take on it however, is that if one disagrees with its "key", it may just fall apart a bit, or if one does not consider the key, the movie feeds a sum of concepts that really should declare themselves as such, to allow awareness when coming into contact with them.
