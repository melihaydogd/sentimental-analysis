Absolute trash!
This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, there is terrible wooden acting from Affleck, who cant seem to remember that is he supposed to be autistic and when he does remember, doesn't seem sure what that even means, Kendrick is so miscast that it is distracting, john Lithgow is completely wasted. It consists of a confusing pointless plot that rambles off into bedtime story type monologues which will have you nodding off. There was a half decent premise here and it was the first casualty in this awful attempt at an action hero thriller. The last 5 minutes are so bad as to be laughable! Do not watch this if you have even a minimum amount of self respect and value your time, do your laundry instead! I fail understand why it has been rated 7.5!?!?!?
