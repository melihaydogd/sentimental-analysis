Run of the mill action film
The A Team as an original TV show was a breath of fresh air in many ways. Filmed during the Reagan years it was the first show for a long time to show Vietnam vets in a positive light. But essentially the A Team was funny, well written and rather harmless fun as no one really ever got hurt and the message was that if you were clever and resourceful you could beat the bullies. All in all it was a great character based show. The big screen adaptation didn't really take any of those elements that defined the show (not even the iconic theme tune) but created an action film loosely based on the basic principle that they were accused of a crime they did not commit. So at the end of the day, this could have been an action film with any four exchangeable characters. As an action film it was okay although I found the action sequences drawn out and too fast paced. As far as the story goes, there wasn't really one but more of an excuse of stringing together the action sequences. It takes almost an hour for the film the get started properly. What I found plainly annoying about the film was the fact that all the locations in Germany were wrong: the aerial shot of Frankfurt actually showed Cologne, the station was not Frankfurt station, car number plates were wrong etc, etc.
