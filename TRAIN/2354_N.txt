Deadlands The Rising: They did the best they could
For some reason I went into Deadlands wanting to like it, not sure why and unfortunately I simply couldn't.A hyper low budget zombie effort this is the first part of a trilogy and is directed by, written by and starring Gary Ugarek.It's your pretty standard stuff, an incident occurs, zombies appear and people do their best to survive. Trouble is it never really gets going, there is no actual story. What you'll be watching for little over any hour is what happens in the first 15-20 minutes of your average zombie movie.Now as you'd imagine it looks and sounds cheap (Because it is) but somehow they make the best of it here. It's amazing what even the slightest bit of talent behind the camera can accomplish.In no way is Deadlands anything even remotely resembling a good film however they certainly get points for effort. Onto the sequel soon I suppose.The Good:Above par soundtrackYou can tell effort was madeThe Bad:Looks/sound cheap and nastyDreadfully paced
