Awful, not even partly good.
Lets start with the acting, in one word, bad, in two, very bad. The main four are acting like someone told them they have just woken up, except for the one who isn't the trained actor, Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson, who stole the movie in my opinion, and no, I am not a wrestling fan.

As for the rest, Face is not a slick operator, Murdock is not really mad, just a bit off the wall and Hannibal, well that's just Liam coasting his way through the film.

The one actress in it looks like if she smiled her face would crack.

Next, the plot twist, not a plot twist more like a slight deviation from a straight line, so very, very obvious and in just about every other action film you've seen. A five year old could have written it.

The effects, some action scenes are done well, others look like they ran out of time and botched it together.

The script has the occasional good one-liners but in the whole film there are about 10, not worth the two hours to find.
