I would have loved to love this, but my god did it not meet any of my expectations
I don't think I have ever given a 1 to a movie on IMDb. But after reading the book I was so anticipating seeing some of the things I've pictured in my mind being visualised on the silver screen. None of this happened, after seeing the movie I don't even know if Scarlet plays the role of Isserley from the book.If I could review the movie without reading the book I would have probably given it quite a decent vote, but at the moment nothing but disappointment sits in my mind about how much possibilities were ahead of the screenwriters and this director and how little of that the managed to grab onto.After seeing this movie I would recommend, either watch the movie or read the book. DO NOT combine these activities. Both are good as separate entities, combining them will result in major disappointment :-(
