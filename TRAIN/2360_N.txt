Wildly Pointless!
It was since 'Misson to Mars' that I didn't see a so wildly pointless movie! A childish script that (as I saw from other comments) requires queer interpretation to try to save the director, dialogs that swing between stupidity and ridiculous (the one in the hospital and the final one with the brother are the best), all the events are gratuitous: no background, no psychological analysis that justify or explain what happens (also the sex scenes... laughable)... I think this is enough to explain why I found this movie really disappointing! A movie like this one could be define like a poor TV-movie. It doesn't deserve the big screen!
