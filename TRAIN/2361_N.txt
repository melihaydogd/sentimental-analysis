Dull film all round.
Oh dear. The frustration of this film is that it should've been so much better than it is.

I mean, look at the cast. It's got talent in it from top to bottom, but they can't shake the fact that the plot is thin, and it doesn't all come together to be anything other than a bog standard romantic comedy.

I liked John Cusack's performance, but apart from that this didn't do a lot of me.
