Too boring and stupid
I wanted to see this so bad and I rented it from Redbox but it turned out to be really really boring. The first part was boring, the middle was boring and the ending is where it was only good. As a horror fan, this was probably one of the worst horror films I ever watched (this movie is definitely making my list.) It was one of those horror films that have a good plot and trailer but turned out to be boring (fell asleep a couple times). The whole movie is just about some mirror that wasn't scary and then they try to make the dead look scary when all I saw was bad looking ghost. If you really want to see a horror movie that is worth watching then please don't watch this movie. You'll just be bored the whole time.
