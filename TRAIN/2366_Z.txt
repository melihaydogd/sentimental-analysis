This was BAD
When you see the dialogue being a continuous effort to describe the esoteric world of the protagonists, instead of it being expressed by their acting, the tension being artificially built up, instead of it being naturally generated by the flow of the movie, the same cliche dilemmas being put on screen again and again instead of them being created in the mind of the audience, you know this film is a failure. Not in a single moment the director and the writer could make their production being worth of such a good material they had in their hands. Is there something worse than chewed food?
