I try to imagine the IQ of the target audience. I can't.
So Cruise is getting older, yet year after year CGI shows him more agile than Jean Claude Van Damme in his good days. Yet this movie's script is very particular.

Cruise is shown as a deserter impersonating an officer, now a prisoner.

1. The prisoner is delivered nice and easy and left to sleep on a pile of luggage. 2. The prisoner is delivered in full officer uniform, minus the trinkets and ornaments. 3. He is a new recruit, so he is going in action. 4. He is unreliable so he must be part of a dangerous mission. 5. Although a mission is prepared and everybody is busy, there is not one, but three NCOs to introduce him to his new life. One that notices that Cruise has just woken up from his slumber, a second that takes over later on and has some papers on Cruise too and a third one right behind to carry the effects of the prisoner.

And this is the good part. Later the script starts making less sense and from all the dialogue the overall idea is something about bow down to your governmental overlords as you alone can't take care of yourself.
