Scores low on the romance scale
Been wanting to see this since it opened.   Finally got hubby and his friend to go, and they really liked it a lot -- but I found it trite.  Every trick in the book -- including a kitten.I objected also to the overwhelming theme of "woman must have man to be happy" that absolutely pervaded this film.  In a well drawn, genre romance the fellow ought be as desirous of a mate as is the woman.   Here, none of the men she hooks up with seem to need her at all.  And she seems to be unable to be whole without a man in her life.Tuscany is beautiful, but we knew that.
