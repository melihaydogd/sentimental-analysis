What happened to security ????? Spoiler Alert
Love the show, but I don't think the writers are making these first new episodes in season 3 credible. Why no armed guards with Spector ? Why is Rose Stag not in a private room under guard ? Why would the they assign a nurse that resembles Spector's victims ? I do hate when they do that !!!! Stella is great as usual, thanks to Gillian Anderson's superb acting, but we need to get out of the hospital now. The writers seemed to have dropped the ball a bit so far, however, I will stay with it on the strength of Stella. I owe her that. I have marked this down from 9/10 for seasons 1 & 2. I do hope the momentum picks up as this progresses as this usually is a gripping drama.
