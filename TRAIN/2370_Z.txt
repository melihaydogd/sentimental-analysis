The movie is okay, at best
A lot of people hated this movie, and it's not hard to see why. The acting is very lackluster. Noah Ringer's performance as Aang lacked the energy and happiness that is seen in the show, Sokka lacked his comedic lines, and Kitara? Whoever played her was freaking horrific. Every time she talked, it sounded like she was reading her lines instead of really acting. Speaking of the names, they are butchered. Is it that hard to get their names right? The use of slow motion is overused, but I still enjoyed it. Some parts looked really cool to me. The movie is guilty pleasure to me. I watched it the other day on Amazon Prime, and I enjoyed it. The fight scenes were entertaining and the score was POWERFUL. The special effects look really nice, (except the airbending scenes. It just looks like it was added on at the last minute). The thing about this movie is that it stuck to the source material some of the time, which is sadly, a lot more than the Percy Jackson movies and Dragonball Evolution. I felt that it was rushed. It tried to fit too much into an hour and a half, and some really important things were missing. But then again, I found this movie fairly enjoyable despite its horrible flaws. I don't know, I guess I just find enjoyment in bad movies.
