"Bollocks!"
This film was entertaining, but it was also agonizing because it was so much worse than it could have been. If you're willing to turn off your mind, perhaps you won't be bothered by the preaching about totalitarian governments. Or the fact that the script feels like it was authored by a committee of writers, each one wanting to add their own elements that pull this movie in about fifteen different directions with no cohesive core other than politically motivated violence. This movie tries to be way too much, and in doing so it is simply not plausible. I can imagine how the scriptwriting went: -- "Hey! Let's go off on a tangent about lesbians." "Great idea!" (High-fives are exchanged.) "Let's talk about viruses for awhile." "Yeah! And what if our masked hero is great at cooking toast and eggs with real butter. Let's show that several times!" "Excellent!" ----- You get the idea. It was like Zorro (with 'V' instead of 'Z') meets Batman Begins, with some not-so-subtle political undertones, lots of shouting, and a script that wastes the talents of Natalie Portman. And despite all the heavy-handed symbolism and shouting, you're left wondering what the point was. This film just doesn't sit well with me. I wouldn't recommend it except to people who are easily amused by typical cinematic trash. You know who you are. Or people who just love hearing the word "bollocks".
