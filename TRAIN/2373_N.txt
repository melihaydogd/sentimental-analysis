A Major Letdown...
Ridley Scott is a legendary filmmaker, his body of work is exception. 'Blade Runner', which is now known to be a Cult Classic by many, in my opinion, is Scott's weakest effort.

'Blade Runner' is based on a epic battle between genetically engineered beings called replicants & and a semi-retired blade runner. It takes place in 2019, 9 years from now, well it seems like a boring future. Let's not forget the that 'Blade Runner' was a box office disaster when originally released. Some films are lucky to earn Cult Status, & this sci-fi flick is surely one of them.

Scott's direction is not up-to the mark, mainly because the script is filled with loose ends. Cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth is worth a mention, his work is great. In the acting department, Harrison Ford has always been a competent actor, and his performance here proves that fact yet again. Rutger Hauer is okay. Others are plain average.

All said n done from this writer, 'Blade Runner' is a overrated classic. A debacle, compared to it's hype. Thumbs Down!
