Coldroom
Room is one of those movies that people read rave reviews about and then adopt it. Having just watched a UK preview screening I wanted to let you know what kind of a movie it really is.<br/><br/>For starters it is really...well...cold. The director has tried a silent approach to take out the emotion and concentrate on the subject matter but has gone too far and left it a bland and dim affair. I was expecting a lot more from the confined direction but not once did I get feeling of claustrophobia. Every character was also very one dimensional and stereotypical.<br/><br/>Too many issues all going at once but none of them were dealt with properly. It&#39;s not a bad movie but I think the bland direction and lack of narrative let it down...I would imagine the book would be far,far superior. Still worth a trip to the cinema because I love movies on the big screen...where they should be...and it will not show well on T,V or DVD.<br/><br/>One of those movies that try to make you think but come across as somewhat pretentious and believes it&#39;s own hype..will not win a single nomination...let alone an award.
