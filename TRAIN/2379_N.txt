But why
I am a fan of the Marvel universe but honestly Deadpool was never my favorite character. More and more recent blockbuster filmography is becoming something a friend of mine calls "a product". That movie was one big joke with the audience and its intrinsic property of influencing or contaminating the one next to you. It illustrated what we usually witness around elections and how you can pump up mediocrity. Ryan Reynolds did his best to save the movie from itself being both a hero and a hooligan. Humor seemed so insipid and worn off to the point it was probably boring even at the time the comic book came out. I guess that contributed to the Deadpool persona, he was meant to be annoying and he really was. The thing that really struck me was the brilliant drama that was very cleverly hinted. It never reached a tipping point and that left me with the impression of a real potential. I sympathized with Wade and his childish cynicism as Deadpool who despite being invincible was fragile and disgusted with the way his life ultimately turned out to be. I really hope there will be no second movie because it will surely lack the drama and will be stripped off its controversy. It is interesting how sometimes bad movies uncover the real potential and talent of the lead actors.
