Very disappointed
well, after reading all the good reviews i thought lets give it a try... unfortunately, a waste of a Saturday night - as many, trying to find a good horror movie nowadays :-)

this movie might be low-budget, i respect that. still, to make it short all characters were just stupid and very predictable, actually the whole movie is quite boring, with a most annoying sound track and not at all an exciting twist how most of the reviews tell here...

i gave it a two, one point more than i initially thought to write, just because of the last 10 sec of the movie which were "almost" bearable.

maybe for teenagers watching the first time a horror-movie, but definitely not for a real horror fan !
