Good acting, boring story
All of the actors in this movie did a fabulous job, which is not an easy feat since the storyline was so incredibly boring. I know it was a true story, but parts were fictionalized to make it more interesting. I can't imagine it being much less interesting. This type of story has been done many times in the past, Silkwood, and Norma Rae come to mind. I don't understand why Russell Crowe was nominated and not Pacino. I think the voters get used to our best actors and actresses always doing such a good job, that when a younger newer actor stands out people fall all over them. At least when there are two good performances in the same film. In summary, I know this is an important story, but it would have been better as a TV movie of the week.
