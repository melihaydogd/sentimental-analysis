Imaginative and fascinating
This is one of the closest things to seeing a dream on screen. There is so much visual imagination and wacky scenarios. You never really know where things will go. The story itself is simple but I guess that's not the point. It was enjoyable even for a non-Beatles fan but it was clearly made just for them.
