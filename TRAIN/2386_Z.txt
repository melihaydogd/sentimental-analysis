Not good
The casting is wrong for Elizabeth and Darcy. Keira Knightly oozes sex and looks like a model. I can't believe she would be cast in this role. She is all about her looks and nothing else which is not right for Elizabeth. The actor who plays Darcy must be truly arrogant in real life because that's all he projects.
