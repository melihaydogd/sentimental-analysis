Enjoy show but...... actually help!
I do enjoy show for entertainment value but GA claims it is doing these investigations to help people, so HELP! Maybe spend less on terrible reenactments and spend 5 minutes at the end of show to wrap things up. Show always seems to end in the middle of the investigation with someone hearing voices or seeing something and then Zac starts narrating over scenes from episode and I'm thinking to myself, how can show be over in the middle of this? It leaves this viewer wondering what happened not only to crew at end of show but also to countless people who called the GA team for assistance.
