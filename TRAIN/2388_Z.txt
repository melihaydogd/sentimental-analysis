While far from great, it was funny and is great to show your ultra-liberal friends!
This film is a comedy that combines Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" with a lampoon on Michael Moore, though for legal reasons he is called "Michael Malone". Malone is an America-bashing film maker who unknowingly is doing the business of Al Qaeda and it's up to the spirits of great Americans like George Patton, George Washington and Trace Adkins(?) to help him see the error of his ways.

AN American CAROL is a decent little comedy, though I will be the first to admit that it isn't particularly sophisticated or deep (it ain't Shakespeare or a Merchant-Ivory production). As it's directed by David Zucker, the film plays like one of the HOT SHOTS films--with rapid-fire hit and miss jokes. Although it's filled with low-brow humor that will make people laugh, sanctimonious liberals who just can't allow themselves to enjoy the film will find it tough going. They'll just be too angry to laugh. In fact, if you do show the film to ultra-liberal friends or family members, it might just induce a stroke or panic attack, as the film abounds with politically incorrect humor--so have paramedics on standby. In other words, if they see Michael Moore as a fair-minded man, then they shouldn't even bother seeing this film--it could just make their heads explode.

Decent acting, a silly script (with about as many hits as misses) and something decidedly different from the usual Hollywood fare, this film is worth seeing for the average person--though those who give it 1s or 10s are just too partisan to believe. It is not for people who are to the far left and I warn them not to watch. They just won't get it and will take it way too seriously! And nothing's worse than listening to a far leftist once they get angry (you know, the kind that can't laugh at anything--just like some on the very very far right).
