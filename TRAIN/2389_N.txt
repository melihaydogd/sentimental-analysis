Neverending Nonsense
A kid escapes from bullies by curling up in the attic of his school with a book that he comes to love so much that it has him in tears. The movie may have the same effect on viewers except that it would be tears from boredom. The book that it's based on is apparently much loved so something must have gotten lost in the translation. The story has no rhyme or rhythm; it is disjointed, uninteresting, and unbelievably contrived, laughably bad in some parts. The whiny kid who plays the warrior looks like a little girl and is rather annoying, as is the cry-baby who is reading the book. The sets are cheesy and the creatures are ridiculous looking in this utter waste of time.
