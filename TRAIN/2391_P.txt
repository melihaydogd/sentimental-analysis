Overlooked comedy
This is a good film which is thoroughly entertaining with some snappy dialogue. None of the actors had really spectacular film careers but in this effort all came to the front of the class with very good performances. The cast mixes well. Without a doubt this is Gabe Kaplan's best effort, even overshadowing his TV role as Mr. Cotter.
