More one for the comic book enthusiasts
Despite never having read a comic book and knowing very little about the different universes and characters I have really enjoyed most the recent film adaptations. However I found this film was far closer to a comic book than the others and didn't make for such a good standalone film for non enthusiasts.However I must say the animation is good and the music enjoyable.
