Better than Insurgent, but still no good
ALLEGIANT is the third film in the DIVERGENT series, following on from the rubbish INSURGENT. Originally there were meant to be four films in the franchise but this film did so badly at the box office that there's talk of the fourth film being a TV movie which will be interesting to say the least. I really don't like this franchise at all, finding it a mere rip-off of THE HUNGER GAMES which was itself a teen-friendly rip-off of BATTLE ROYALE, but the good news is that ALLEGIANT is much better than the last film in the series, although that doesn't make it good.

INSURGENT was all about predictability and mindless action whereas ALLEGIANT at least has a plot of sorts, even if it isn't a very good one. The same problems that exist with the first two films are also present here, with too much time given over to teen moping around and all of the established adult stars limited to showing up, intoning a few lines of dialogue, and disappearing again. Shailene Woodley makes for an ultra-annoying heroine and hardly someone you can root for. The running time is overlong and too much of the story is padded out with scenes of characters travelling around. The thing that annoys me is the needless way they throw in CGI shot after CGI shot as if that's going to hold the attention; the bit where they float about in those giant bubbles is the nadir of this film. Still, some of the sub-plots are mildly interesting, and at least this film appears to be going somewhere which is better than normal for the franchise.
