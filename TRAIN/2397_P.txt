I love this Accident, its just darling and very funny!
Poor Alice (Jessica Biel, never better). She works as a carhop waitress on skates and she glides beautifully. This results in her attracting the attentions of Trooper Scott (James Marsden) who is ready to propose after only a few months. But, alas, when Scotty takes Alice to the posh Gondola Restaurant in their small Indiana town, their dinner is interrupted by a construction worker with a nail gun near their table. What gives? In the ensuing discussion about the atmosphere being ruined and the ring not fitting, the worker trips and a nail goes into Alice's head! No, she's not killed, Praise the Lord, but its in a very tricky place and needs to be removed. Unfortunately, Alice has no insurance, Scott gets cold feet and neither her parents or vet friend (Kirstie Alley) can help. What's more, the nail is rubbing Alice's emotional brain spots and she can get angry and sex-crazed easily. Woe to her when she upsets a tray on a customer, in anger, and loses her job. What's a girl to do? Spying a television ad for her congressman, Howard (Jake Gyllenhaal), her best bet seems to travel to DC and ask him for aid. Too bad he's go green and clueless but he does like Alice's hot looks! This darling film was written by the man behind Silver Linings Playbook and its non-stop fun. Biel is lovely and terrific as Alice while Marsden, Gyllenhaal, Tracy Morgan, Beverly Deangelo, Alley and all of the cast are first rate. The setting is sweet and costumes definitely enhance Biel's beauty. Add on the lively direction and what's not to love? It will be no accident if you end up cheering for Alice and company!
