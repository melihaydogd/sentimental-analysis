Waste of time.
Everybody wants some If you're going to do product placement in a 70's movie, you should use props that look like they're from the 70s or 80s or whenever this lame hipster movie is posing as. I wasn't even alive back then but even I can tell you Dr. Pepper soda pop cans looked different, with a bigger top; not like the current can with a smaller head and bigger body. I wouldn't have even noticed if the product placement was so obvious and had as much screen time as it did. For a time span of at least 5 minutes it seemed like half the cast and extras walking around in the streets were drinking nothing but Dr. Pepper out of cans from 30 years into the future.

Anyway, the film has a high production value but no real story. It is just a series of ultra- clean and artificial scenes of what someone who as never watched a film made in the seventies thinks the seventies looked like. You can tell a lot of money was put into this film, too bad they didn't chuck-in a few dollars more and buy a decent script.
