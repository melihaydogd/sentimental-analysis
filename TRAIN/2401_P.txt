Not perfect, but polished and pretty darn great
I'm a sucker for any movie that involves close-ups of newspapers being printed, but this story was particularly well told - as polished as you would expect from Spielberg, Streep, Hanks and co. It was funny and enthralling and just plain solid storytelling. In fact, Spielberg even managed to tone back his over-the-top-ness. There are few moments where odes of love to the press could be more important. So while there are flaws here (in pacing and in storytelling devices), this is as entertaining and informative of a Saturday night as you could ask for.
