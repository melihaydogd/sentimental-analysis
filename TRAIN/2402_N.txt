Not a laugh in the entire movie
I have now watched this movie three times and have yet to crack a smile, much less laugh. I know I sound like a masochist for subjecting myself to this punishment, but I just could not believe a popular movie could be this bad. I assumed I missed something but every time I watched the film, it seemed worse than the time before. Absolutely nothing imaginative, creative, or witty in the entire film except the brief bit with Peter Dinklage who can actually act. Everyone else simply embarrasses themselves except for Farrell, who apparently cannot be embarrassed because he continues to make endlessly lame and boring films and has yet to figure out why people like Belushi, Steve Martin, and Bill Murray are funny and he is not. Picking old gum off a rail and putting it in your mouth is not funny, Will. Wearing tights as an overly tall elf is not funny. Belushi dressed as a samurai warrior is funny. Now we have "Elf" plus "Anchorman," "Talledega Nights," "The Campaign," etc. Please stop. The pain is too great!!!
