Great music, beautiful visuals
Just like many people here, I heard great stories about this movie. I expected a way better movie, and was quite disappointed. The storyline is empty and doesn't really get you anywhere. The reason why this movie stayed on my mind was mainly because of the music. The feeling I think they wanted to create didn't get to me through the movie itself, but through the music. The visuals/cinematography are/is great, which made it for me still a pleasant movie to watch in the end, but definitely not because of the storyline. Although I am going to keep listening to the music, I definitely don't want to watch this movie ever again.
