Decent drama, weak horror
The unique setting was refreshing, and it was interesting to see the protagonist struggle with being suffocated by familial, societal, and even supernatural pressures.But... the horror aspects were much weaker than reviews led me to believe. I don't think it had any tension, effective scares (unless you count being startled by a noise), or even a strong plot. The biggest flaw is the reason for the protagonist's entire motivation for staying. Seriously, if someone tried to pitch me that idea I would tell them to try harder. By the time the daughter screamed for her doll for what felt like the 50th time, I could only think about how I would have taped the thing to her hand to stop her nonsense.Don't get me wrong, I don't mind drama or social commentary in my horror films. In fact those topics can often add complexity and dimension. This, however, is not enough horror to be a horror film but with too much horror to be a family drama.
