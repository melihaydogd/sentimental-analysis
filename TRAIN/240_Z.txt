Worths the watch for them actings
It is a good movie. An interesting, important and controversial subject that has to be known and given some thought. There's a really good work from the main actors, McConaughey and Leto, they're two actors that really give everything (even physically) to portrait their characters, and that gives a lot of weight to the film and credibility to the story. I didn't liked so much Garner though, maybe in contrast with the other two she looked washed out.. More than the actings, and with all the respect I have for the subject and everyone that can feel affected by it, I didn't think that the movie itself was that great. Maybe the script lacked a bit of strength, I don't know what was it but was missing a bit of something... It's just my personal opinion, no more than that.

Very good acting, fair script, fair photography. Worths watching.
