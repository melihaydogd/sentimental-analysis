Great depth, you must watch 2-3 times to get it
Despite the undoubtedly awesome aesthetics, the smooth photography, a great Tom Cruise and an even great Andrea Riseborough, the movie has actually a fantastic plot. There are plenty of hints around the movie in times that you will not get them, but will shape you a feeling you will not be able to understand. The movie's depth is great, you will need to watch it 2-3 times to fully understand a look, a word or even a slight move in the first 3 minutes that actually gives a big hint about what is happening around.Finally, in lots of scenes but also in general, there are plenty of messages-opinions having to do with modern people's way of living.PS. The music is....fantastic. It connects superbly with every scene.Best movie in 2013 for me.
