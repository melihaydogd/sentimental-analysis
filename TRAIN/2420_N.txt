Mediocre, but good special FX and comedy
Aside from Johnny Depp's Quirky performance -- always worth watching -- this was a pretty lame attempt at action-comedy. The special effects were of course competent, and the camera work was good, but the writing and plot were thin and amateurish.  Perhaps I should not have expected more, given that it's just a Disney SFX vehicle with a bankable lead, but I thought this fell far short of the hype. The apparent premise that some of them were dead and cursed to go on and on ... it seemed to change somehow toward the end, as if no one was sure what the rules really were.   It's set up of course for a seQuel, probably even lamer than this one. I wouldn't have minded if I hadn't paid four bucks to see the thing on Pay Per View, but I guessed wrong on this one.
