 Overrated
The movie isnt that good folks. It isn't. The STORY (over the three volumes as purists want to say, it is all one story just published as three volumes]) is good, and the movie looks fantastic and looks what one imagines in the mind as the reader reads, but it doesnt make a good movie.The movie stinks.  Just like Episode 1 stinks.  But "everybody" loved it when it came out except 1000 people in the world. I was one. Believe me, in a few years, you wont think this is such a great movie.  only if one watches all 3 LOTR movies does one think it s good.  by themselves, they stink.
