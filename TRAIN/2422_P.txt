Brilliant
The actress that plays lead is fabulous, the story is phenomenal. 
I would love to go on and on about how thoroughly I enjoyed this piece of work but I am afraid to give any spoilers. Watching with subtitles is the way to go, however I know some folks are not fond of them so they would steer away from it solely for that reason, however netflix has dubbed a lot of foreign movies with a long list on language audio. Check it out, so expertly done,
