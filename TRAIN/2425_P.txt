Great Work....
Mike Cahill deserves kudos for making an attempt like 'King Of California'. A unique idea, translated into a lovely piece of cinema. The 2007 flick, succeeds.... Big Time!

You don't expect 'King Of California' to be a milestone.... and that's the beauty of it. The expectations are medium, and you when finish the screening, you're taken by a pleasant surprise. As mentioned earlier from this writer, this film works big time.

In all departments the film works. The Writer-Director keeps your attention held almost throughout. The Cinematography is brilliant; maintaining a consistent look throughout.

The Performances are outstanding: Michael Douglas is remarkable. Playing his part with amazing understanding, easily one of his careers best works. Evan Rachel Wood is excellent from start to end.

All said n done, 'King Of California' is classy work, neat work. I give it, Two Thumbs Up!
