Not the Simpsons
Wow, anybody that thought this movie was great cannot be a real Simpsons fan. I knew it was going to be trash so I put off seeing it as long as I could. It truly couldn't be any worse. If you liked it watch seasons 1-8 and then you will know why it terrible. The jokes are geared towards to teens with immature senses of humor. The biggest problem I have with this movie is when you seen Bart's private part. What is that all about. I a college student and I'm cool to most things pertaining to nudity but families borough their kids to this not expecting that. It was not needed not called for. The Simpsons crew should have stopped writing 9 years ago and the viewers should have stopped watching 10 years ago. Do to the high rating I have to say people are dumber than i thought.
