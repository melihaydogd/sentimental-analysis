Underwhelmed.
I am trying to be patient with this Hollywood fantasy about ranch life. It is hard for me to understand a lot of the dialogue. Lots of muttering. Found it amusing when a 60 something ranch owner climbs aboard a quarter horse posing as a mustang and tries to saddle break it. It pales next to Longmire.
