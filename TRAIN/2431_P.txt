All you need from an action movie.. engines, explosions and Vin Diesel
This movie picks up from where the first movie left off. Dominic(Vin Diesel) and Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) are hiding pulling jobs just for the fun of it but Dom knows that none's safe around him and decides to leave Letty. In the city FBI is trying to get their hands on the Drug-lord (Campos) and Brian (Paul Walker) is on the hunt. Letty makes a deal with Brian to cleanse Dom of all charges and in turn go in undercover as an informant. A job goes bad and she gets killed by the bad guy (Fenix) who works for Campos. Dom goes hungry for revenge and is back on the streets looking for the killer. Brian and Dom team up in catching these bad guys and of course Dom kills Felix. In between all this plot is extreme street racing with big engines and loads of action. The movie is well directed and fully satiates your hunger for action adventure and speeding cars. I just loved the first movie so i always wanted the same cast appearing again and thankfully this one didn't disappoint.Vin Diesel is as good as ever.. his screen presence is phenomenal and rest of the cast is great too. I quite liked the opening car race sequence and the rest of the movie was good enough to keep me glued to the chair. Well in the end Dom gets a trial and Brian as an FBI officer testifies and pleads for dropping of all charges but court finds him guilty and sentences 25 years. Brian and Dom's sister get furious with all this and try to get Dom out and thats where it ends. Another open ending for a possible sequel which makes everyone happy i guess.
