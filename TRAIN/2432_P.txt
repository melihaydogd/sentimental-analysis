Women desire
To me, this movie is about the fear of women, like many of the Hollywood dark movies, only this one is darker then most of them.Women are creatures of desire, desire makes women dangerous. When women want, you better give. Roy refused to satisfy them, twice, bad things happened each time, both times it gives you a big shock. Although there are other bad things that scare you in this movie, the most scary things are to think what women are capable of when they are denied of their satisfactions. Imaging this is what your girlfriend and your mother are capable of, potentially, what a terror!You can understand Lily, in some way, why she is so desperate. You can feel sympathy for her when how she cried after Roy's death but this is still one of the most shocking moments of mother-son relationship in Hollywood history, it still thrills you, and hope you haven't seen this movie. You can't help to ask: does it have to happen? Myra seems such a sweet girlfriend at times that you hope to see some happy ending of these two, when she failed Roy, you kind of hope Lilly and Roy can finally get along, because you can really see they do care about each other, but no, none of these happened, everything turned as bad as it can get, all because of women desire.
