Oh my heavens is this show TERRIBLE!!!
I gave this a rating of 3 hoping to reach sane people looking at reviews wondering if they should watch this show. It is a 1 AT MOST, but I figured that if I rated it 1 no one would look at my comments. This show is so very, very bad. Do not spend any time on this. There is nothing here of any quality, which by itself is bad enough. The real problem is that just about everything is of negative entertainment value! The writing, plot, sub-plots, dialog (it is horrible!), characters, actors, pace - everything is junk, junk, junk!! PLEASE - save yourself!
