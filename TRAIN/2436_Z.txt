Ending lost me
Despite the unexplained ending, the film was pretty solid. I liked the plot and it had some great acting. It had a very small cast and most of the movie was filmed inside of a bar. Proving that you don't need a huge budget and large cast to make a good movie. I just wished the ending was explained. There was no clarification on who Jimmy Thompson was or why he put a hit on the bartender. Leaving us lost in the end. Either way I still think this film is worth a watch. 6 stars.
