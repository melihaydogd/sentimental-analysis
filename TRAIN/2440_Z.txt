Does Not Rate the Hype It Has Received
After seeing the OBL movie that National Geographic hyped (and was extremely poor) I had hoped this would be much better. I was wrong. Yes, more money was spent on this movie, with better actors, director, script (?), editing, etc.; however, the movie is nowhere near as factual as claimed. Wrong equipment, adding characters, fattening the story with trivial embellishment, creating situations that never happened, changing the story to what they want it to be, just ruined this movie. OBL was taken to a carrier in the Arabian Sea, proved to be OBL, then he was buried in the Arabian Sea. There is more inventive people and scenes in this movie; however, over time, it has proved to be more accurate than the other movie. Yes, it is better.
