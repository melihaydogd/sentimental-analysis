Quality Humor overshadowed by poor story
I found Deadpool to be somewhat of a disappointment. Like many I was psyched to see what could be done with an R rated superhero movie and it definitely had its merits.

The constant crude humor and comic references make it bearable for superhero lovers and perhaps enjoyable if one is willing to pull the wool over their eyes and not engage in the meat of the movie: the plot.

A basic love story which fails miserably in getting one to care for the characters portrayed. There is a weak bond made with the audience and the lead characters. We find ourselves finding Negasonic Teenage Warhead the only engaging character in the entire film. The others are too abstract and annoying for the majority of the time. Not what I was hoping for. Story too weak to fully be content with it as anything other than a token R rated superhero film.
