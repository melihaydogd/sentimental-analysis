The Movie Equivalent of a Self-Indulgent Blog
The rise of blogs has created a culture in which every Tom, Dick and Harry is able to make every minor inconsequential thought that pops into his head known to the entire world and consequently convinces him, and perhaps some of his readers, that what he has to say is far more important than it is.

The blog culture is also responsible for movies like "Eat Pray Love," a pointless movie about an affluent, privileged woman's quest to "find herself," which really means eliminate from her life anything resembling a responsibility and go off to enjoy everything that's clich√© and trendy about world culture -- eating a lot of good food in Italy, meditating in India, etc.

I think people should be free to do whatever they want with their lives, provided they don't hurt other people along the way, and if they have the free time and the money to go travel around the world doing nothing, more power to them. But what I ask in return is that they not then bore me with all of their whining about vague problems, or think they're inherently interesting when they're coming to life conclusions the rest of us came to when we were twenty-five.

The character played by Julia Roberts doesn't make a lick of sense, because Roberts is far too confident a screen presence and not nearly a good enough actress to make us understand what this woman's problem is. It's certainly not money or lack of free time, since she spends all of the movie's running time lounging around Italian cafes and beaches in Bali looking like a photo spread in a travel magazine. The gorgeous scenery is appealing for a while, but certainly not enough to warrant a running time of 2:25.

As far as I can tell, her real problem seems to be MEN, which are represented by a handful of recognizable and wasted actors (Billy Crudup, James Franco, Javier Bardem) and only one of whom (Richard Jenkins) has a chance to build anything resembling a character of consequence. Unfortunately, Jenkins is such a good actor and his character's problems so much more significant and real than Roberts', that he only serves to make us more intolerant of her blathering.
