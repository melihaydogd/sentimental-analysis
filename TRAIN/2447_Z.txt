A pretty ordinary film with a few highlights.
Not sure what all the fuss is about. Yes it does have some good moments, particularly the flashbacks. But generally the storyline is unconvincing and rather too convenient.

One man, with a dog, surviving alone for three years in a deserted city, striving to save mankind by finding a cure for a deadly virus, fighting infinite numbers of zombies, building his mansion into a fortress that even George Bush would envy, broadcasting messages on AM radio, and yet having the time to hunt deer in the city and practice driving golf balls.... oh come on.

Then he flips out and is rescued by a Brazilian accompanied by a child who, she claims, is following messages from God. Naaahhhhhhh.

Sorry... I enjoyed the film to a point but would not bother watching it again.

I would also run against some other reviews and say that quite frankly that Will Smith has done better. Or maybe the story needed a different type of character.
