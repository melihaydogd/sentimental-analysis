Directed by the late:Emile Ardolino (Sister Act) made an enjoyable, entertaining, sensual love story that focus on the early sixties. This was one of the most popular feel good movies ever made during 1980's. The film has an terrific soundtrack but this movie oddest charm that some of the music is from 1980's.
