Liberal progressive indoctrination at its best (worst).
An oppressive Christian government hellbent on cleansing the world of non heterosexuals? Rented the DVD because all the rave reviews. Stopped watching it at the prison scene with the lesbian. You've got to be kidding me. The emotional rhetoric here makes me want to vomit. This is so typical of liberals, not able to use facts and reason to explain there self centered social and political beliefs so instead they make some movie that twists things around. The real Nazis in this country are the liberals trying to portray Christians as hate mongers. I myself by the way not even being Christian. Furthermore, they glorify terrorism as "heroic". Not that guerrilla warfare isn't necessary sometimes but it sure is coincidental with all the terrorist crap going on. Look I hate our C- president too but put aside your bias (which most never will because there ideologues who blog on liberal web pages all day and take statements made by non-liberals out of context) and look at the movie objectively. It turns out this is just another clich√© hot chick hero saving the world movie. We live in a polarized country and the opinions made by people about how great and brilliant this movie was because of the alternative lifestyle theme obviously show the divide that exists between traditionalists and progressives.
