Don't get all the hype
Well I'm not really sure why this movie get such high ratings. It's decent but certainly not as good as I was expecting. There are better chick flicks out there that's for sure. If you want to impress your date try watching Nottinghill. Thats a great chick flick. This one is boring, predictable and way too slow... Next!
