Michael Douglas looking for the treasure
16-year old Miranda's father Charlie returns from the loony bin.Now Charlie believes there's a long-lost treasure of Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres buried nearby their California house.Soon he's off with his daughter to go treasure hunting.She gets a job at Costco, underneath which the treasure should be located.King of California (2007) is directed by Mike Cahill and produced by Alexander Payne.Michael Douglas does amazing job in the lead as Charlie.Mr. Douglas is a fantastic actor who we in the future can call a cancer survivor, I'm sure.I'm very hopeful after having heard that his father, Kirk Douglas, told in an interview how his son is in a better shape now.So Michael Douglas really makes this movie, but I must give credit to Evan Rachel Wood, who plays his daughter Miranda.They both play their parts just brilliantly.Allisyn Ashley Arm plays Young Miranda.Willis Burks II is Pepper.Paul Lieber and Kathleen Wilhoite are Doug and Kelly.This is a very beautiful film.It offers some great drama and comedy.Like the scene where they dig around the golf course is quite funny.It's just amazing to watch when Charlie is diving at the underground river, searching for the treasure.Charlie is the most tragicomic character, and you really like him.You really hope he finds the treasure at the end.
