Total Disappointment!!!
The acting is, in a lot of roles, irritating. Some of the roles though are played well like Rorschach and The Comedian. The voice of Dr.Manhattan is just irritating, also the appearance and the behavior of Ozymandias is also very very poor.

The special effects are annoying at best. Constant slow motion, crappy flashbacks and irritating sounds.

The story is changed in small, but irritating ways. I mean the violence is blown out of proportion, but the body of the comic, the whole point of it all just disappeared. It just became a big budget, commercial, Hollywood action movie.

After watching this i really doubt the intellect of Snyder, the comic is a brilliant piece of work, and it's really hard to ruin it, but he did it, well actually that is an amazing feat.

All in all the film is a huge disappointment and just gives the comic a bad name. If it were up to me I'd give a different synopsis something like blood, slow motion, and 3 hours of total boredom and irritation. Alan Moore was right not to take credit for this piece of crap.
