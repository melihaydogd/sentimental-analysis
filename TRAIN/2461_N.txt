Yee-hah! - Ride 'em, spaceboy!
How do you hypnotize millions of film-goers into a quasi-psychotic state in which they honestly believe that have seen something, when they are just watching high-school kids masturbate? George Lucas seems to have that down to an art. I think he does it by rewriting every cliché in the book so that they all seem to have come out-takes from "The Wizard of OZ".This is definitely aimed primarily at the Mid-West US - listen to these voices - rather like hearing Johnny Carson make a serious pitch for the Jerry lewis Telethon. And these supposedly "weird" other worlds look an awful lot like Missouri and Oklahoma. And the big spacecraft - isn't that some Ford factory they closed down in Minnesota a few years back? What's alarming here is the sad lack of imagination. Really, you need to have taken too much meth and stayed up one night too many to be able to appreciate this film - to be allow Lucas and co. convince you that there's a film to watch here.An old Republic matinée western remade as a Saturday morning cartoon by/for survivors of one acid trip too many - or too few.Save your sanity; find something real to do.
