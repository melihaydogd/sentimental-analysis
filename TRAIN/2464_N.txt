Easily the worst movie of 2008
This was possibly the worst movie I've seen all year, there couldn't have possibly been a worst line of actors, Jim Carey has got to be at least in his forties and he picked a less-than-great actress who just happened to be in her twenties for a make out scene. The movie was so predictable that i was able to call every plot twist dozens of minutes before they happened. And i was extremely tempted to leave the theater when Carey was hanging after bungee jumping and he answered his cell phone, "Oh nothing just hanging here", if it wasn't for the people who had their legs up on the seats i would have left the movie right then and there. I wouldn't be surprised to see this movie on 2008's "Worst movies of the year".
