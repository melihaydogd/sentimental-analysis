Absolutely brilliant
After thinking Thor: Ragnorok wasn't really worth my efforts, I was so happy with this instalment from Marvel. I hope they don't get bright and get a new director for subsequent BP films that turns it into everything i disliked in Thor as well as GOTG.

I cannot fault Black Panther - it even inspired me to want to shave my head for a moment (then sense took over). It was a beautiful film. Women rock. I loved the rituals. I loved the fact it incorporated fashions from all over Africa - but Tchaka wore Ntoma from Ghana worthy of a King.

At my viewing there was a round of applause.

But the best bit was seeing the look of delight on my friend's daughter who was allowed to stay up post bed time to watch BP. She was captivated. To all the naysayers, if they could see the looks of amazement that girls and boys alike will have as they watch, then they may take several seats.
