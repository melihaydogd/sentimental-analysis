Rick's Reviews
I have always stayed away from gravitas ventures movies as they are generally very poor in acting, story lines and often low budget visuals, only this movie The Oak Room got my interest as actor RJ Mitt was one of the roles (I also have watched every movie possible so running out of movies ) The Oak Room is a little bit of a slow burner however I think this helps building up each character in this movie, this movie also had for me nice little plot twists that kept me intrigued and compelled me to keep watching, the acting for me was great for this movie as I mentioned earlier.. I was pleasantly surprised. As a film buff I would say this is definitely worth a watch if you have nothing else in your library.
