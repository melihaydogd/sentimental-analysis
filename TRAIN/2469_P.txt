Smart, fast, and well delivered. Pay attention, and enjoy the ride.
First just a solid at a'boy to the entire team on this one, and great work all around pulling this off. I have been looking forward to finding out what the hype was all about with this one, and now that it's done I can safely say I Enjoyed that ride. Two time lines intersecting, and the power of the mirror to tear your brain to bits as it eats something from within you that it will never give back. Excellent work crossing back and forth between the 2 time lines, and the way they would almost influence each other was really tightly delivered. Then as you have just become comfortable you will scream "Why!" and you will already know. Very predictable ending, but you have to leave things this way or it's too hard to start writing the sequel. The scares are decent, and the gore is not excessive, but still feels mostly real. The opening feels slow, and that could be to make up for the abrupt ending, or I could just be thinking too much. Totally recommended to suspense/horror style movies, this is so much smarter than the Paranormal Activity style movies. Perfect for a late night with good friends, as this will leave you talking.
