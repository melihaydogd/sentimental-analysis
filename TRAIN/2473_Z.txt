Didn't feel the la la..
After seeing the trailer, I really did not find it interesting. Then I watched the Greatest Showman (sorry, I had to mention that here).. and found out that the composers of the songs there also composed songs in this movie. I was pretty excited more of hearing the songs and hope they can be memorable like the Greatest Showman movie. And in addition, this one has a higher rating and bagged many awards. Sad to say, it was not appealing to me. I hardly remember any song after watching the movie. On the acting, I don't know what's with Ryan Gosling but I feel bored watching him. And it felt like he and Emma didn't gel very well. On the story, well.. that makes up most of my rating. Good story with a hit on reality that when pursuing dreams, you had to give up other things that are important to you..

Well, this is isn't really a type of movie I would go for. Not a movie I would recommend to friends.. it's okay just to learn the story by reading about it..
