A dull thriller that lacks both originality and credibility
Eagle Eye comes with a story that seems all too familiar and uninspired for a thriller movie that was released in 2008. That said, it is likely that its plot will remind the viewer of a handful of thrillers that he or she might have seen before, and the viewer will eventually realize that all of these thrillers were released five to ten years prior to Eagle Eye.

For me, it generally felt like watching a remake of the 1998 thriller Enemy of the State. Of course, it would be a remake that was done pretty sloppily and its plot would prove to be far more preposterous. The visual appearance of Eagle Eye and many of its tropes followed suit. Thus, the feeling of originality plunged to the lowest possible level after just a few minutes of watching. An additional source of annoyance was the frequent use of the shaky camera, which I rarely find to work well as a stylistic device.

The characters seemed chronically underdeveloped and gave me the impression that I had seen them in dozens of thrillers and other movies from the aforementioned time span. There were some lengthy car chases, but none of them proved to be really exciting and the reasons behind them were pretty obscure. At the end of the day, all that I could remember from these sequences were the images of countless vehicles being wrecked in an utterly cartoonish fashion.

Finally, there were quite a few occasions when the characters' banal behavioral patterns and opinions made me chuckle, with their lacking credibility certainly being supported by the fact that the performances turned out to be fairly mediocre throughout the movie.
