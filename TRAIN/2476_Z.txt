Funny How the Tide Turns
Movies like this predicted the impersonal horrific lives of the working class under the rule of big business. But now nearly 100 years later we see that it's actually the LEFT political class that wants to control everything we do and say.

Speech, earnings, transportation, you name it, they want to control every aspect of our lives and if we disagree with their self imposed status quo, they take aim to destroy us.

At every turn they try to squech freedom.

Wake up people. Fantasy is becoming reality and the left is responsible for taking your freedoms away.
