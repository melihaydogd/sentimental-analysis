Has the same pros and cons as the first movie- in short unexceptional but watchable
I am not sure which of the two is better, so I am going to say that in my eyes this sequel is on the same level as its predecessor albeit with one improvement. Neither movie is as good as the timeless TV show or the wonderful Chipmunk Adventure, but in many ways more than one both are cute and harmless movies without trying to be 5-star masterpieces.

Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel has cons that are similar to its predecessor. As with the first, the film is very predictable with some clich√©d human characters and situations, though in fairness a lot of animated/live action films do have that problem as well. Also it does have some hits and misses in the script with some jokes that parents might groan at. The film is rather short and rushed as well.

Faults aside, the film does have an improvement, the performance of Jason Lee as David. In the first he was miscast and out of his depth, here he is much more comfortable and relaxed. Visually and technically, I have little to fault it either. The photography and editing is crisp without being award-worthy, the location work is quite colourful and striking and the animation on the chipmunks again is spot on being very cute. The chipmunks are adorable with voices that are thankfully not irritating, and as with the first Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel nails the personalities of the chipmunks, Theodore again being the best realised. And the soundtrack is very catchy, with tuneful melodies and sweet lyrics, which kids will love and adults will possibly tolerate too.

Overall, unexceptional but watchable family entertainment. 6/10 Bethany Cox
