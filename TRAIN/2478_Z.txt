Typical Disney.
This is typical Disney goodie two shoes stuff, big on stereotypes and happy endings starring a cast of nobodies and produced only to make money with no message, no substance and no dramatic value. Disney, grinding out adult movies like sausages under its "Touchstone" brand name really is "the great satan." This follows one of maybe five basic Touchstone plots. Thats what happens when  accountants are turned loose making movies. But having said that, it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes with some nice Italian atmosphere. I had to balance my love of Italy with my loathing for Disney. I gave it a 5 which probably was generous.
