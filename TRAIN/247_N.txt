 Like watching paint dry
When I bought this movie I thought it was going to be a grand epic adventure. Although it was that, it failed to keep my attention. I have a very good attention span and never fall asleep during movies but I just couldn't sit still during this movie. The story was good and the directing was good but it lacked action. Not fighting action but I mean as in stuff happens because nothing really happens. Its very corny "You shall not pass!"so corny. Reminds me of a Dungeons and Dragons meet or something. Although the last movie in the series is good,this certainly isn't; I had a tough time falling asleep once so I decided to watch this movie and that became my replacement for warm milk. Great for fans but for anyone else this will fail to catch your interest.
