The books wins again...
Having read the fabulous 'Into Thin Air' by Jon Krakauer I was excited to see posters around London promoting the film. The trailers certainly guaranteed a spectacular trip and the promise of 3d only added to my excitement. I watched the film last night but am sad to report that the film, as is often the case, failed to live up to the standards of the book.

Those that have read Into Thin Air will find the main protagonist being changed, serious omissions of the dangers of the climb but more unforgiving, omissions of the sequence of coincidental events that led up to the fatal tragedy.

The movie fails miserably in creating any emotional connection with the characters - Jon's character made largely insignificant. Scott Fischer is portrayed as a young hippie and Beck as nothing more than a loud mouth arrogant American with an estranged relationship with his wife. This lack of emotion ultimately sets the film up to fail as many of the protagonists meet their end. There is no shock and little empathy (perhaps none would be created if the movie had not started off by confirming it is based on a true event).

The use of 3d effects is minimal which is a real shame as I felt this type of movie would have had great potential. There are few jolting moments and the ascent to Everest is portrayed as fun and easy rather than harrowing and arduous.

All in all a film still worth watching in the cinema but best to keep expectations very low. This is neither a documentary nor an action adventure.
