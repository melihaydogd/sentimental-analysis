Did they put something in the popcorn?
'The Accountant' is a dreary, overlong, bore of a movie. A weak storyline, poorly told, and plenty of mundane exposition and flashbacks about characters we're given no reason at all to care about. I disregarded the middling critical consensus of this film, and watched it based on audience opinion here on IMDb (currently 7.3) and Rotten Tomatoes (currently 76% by audiencemeter). Well, I feel duped. After a certain point I just wanted it to end. The action scenes were okay, but can't make up for an absence of good characters and storytelling. Save yourself 127 minutes, and and avoid this poor effort.
