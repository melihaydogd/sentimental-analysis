Gay movie do not watch
Pros: Morena Baccarin is hot hot hot.great video tricks. very well set car and motorcycle chase, almost like in the matrix. good martial arts moves although not realistic. great sound effects. great slow motion.good flashback-N-forth.actors are talented enough. Cons:movie promotes gay superhero. This movie is dedicated to promote the idea that even superhero can be gay. story is weak and includes a lot of unnecessary scenes perhaps just to add more minutes as many scenes just to fill time and won't make a difference if deleted from the movie. Hetro audience will hate this movie because it is gay gay gay. A bollywood actor was shoved in the movie seemingly for no reason unless he was a producer or partner. Final Word:Do not waste your time; it is not worth it.
