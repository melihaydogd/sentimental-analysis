A brilliant modern day reconstruction of The Great Gatsby!
Andrew Lauren Productions rocks the screen with this sexy and sophisticated interpretation of the American Classic, The Great Gatsby. The cast is simply superb, while jammin' rap seated next to a sultry film noir saxophone elevate the film above its blasé contenders. This new form of Bourgeois Hip Hop embodies familiar issues of love, betrayal, and jealously, giving universal> thematic understanding and sympathy for the characters. And who better to portray the elegant complexity of Gatsby than Richard T. Jones. All in all, `G' presents a sort of filmic intelligence never before investigated, executing racial and socioeconomic devices that purge the Hamptons of it's white-bread communal exclusivity. If you thought Lizzie Grubman caused a stir, check out `G'!
