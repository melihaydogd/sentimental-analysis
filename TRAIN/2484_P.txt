Want to fall in love
Heard about this movie sometime after 2015, finally saw the movie in 2020. What can I say, now my favorite romantic movie by far!! Want to fall in love again after a long time.

What a beautiful movie, the natural conversations, great direction, acting and the star of the movie "locations" All this put together takes you to a magical word which most probably doesn't exist in the real world.
