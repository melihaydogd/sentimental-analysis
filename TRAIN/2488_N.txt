I want my money back
So the only selling point of this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years. Wow, yeah, crazy. You know what else happened over a period of 12 years? Lots of nothing to lots of other people, just like in this movie, in which nothing freaking happens.

12 years and this is what they came up with? For crying out loud. This movie is less interesting than watching paint dry in the middle of an Arkansas corn field for 12 years. Maybe my life's so much more interesting than everyone else's who gave this movie rave reviews. Are people so boring that it's now cool to pay to watch nothing happen on a screen? And the guy is gay! Didn't anyone else notice that? I've nothing against gay people but we're supposed to believe he's straight. Come on. If that'd been acknowledged at least there might have been something interesting there: look, he's finally coming out of the closet. Shocker!

And what did these people have against hair brushes? Maybe it's too much excitement to brush your hair and it might have given the movie an air of something actually happening, a hint of not so awfully-boring-why-God-did-I-agree-to-watch-this-?! I want a refund.
