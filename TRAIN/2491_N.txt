For god sake, who approved this script?
I'm trying to swallow this movie, but so far I just couldn't.

I will be brief because this thing don't deserve more than a few lines from me, first the acting is poor from the beginning to the end, the characters are flat and history doesn't make any sense on the real world, I know that this is a movie based on a game and I may not expect too much, but this movie is a catastrophe.

There are several dramatic scenes that should make you feel something about the characters but you don't feel nothing at all, specially because everyone of the dramatic sequences are fallowed by an unrealistic and illogical event, you have to watch it to understand...

The races are boring, the action on the movie is kind of lazy, you feel like there are lots of ultra expensive cars running at 40 miles per hour and a Parkinson guy holding the camera.

So if you want to get a big disappointment watch Need for Speed.

If you don't believe me and want to watch this pearl make something as you watch, do the math and calculate the profit, you will know what I mean when you finish the movie.
