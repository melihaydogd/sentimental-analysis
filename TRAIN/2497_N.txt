I *Still* Don't Get It...
I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. 

I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! 

I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. 

The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. 

There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. 

Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. 

Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole.

Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. 

And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. 

It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".
