Prepare your ears for pain.
"Although the visuals and some of the scares are pretty cool, for no reason at all theres some auditory jump-scares equivalent to nails on a chalkboard and radio-static and screaming at an unnaturally high volume all in the same go multiple times, making the viewing experience much more unpleasant than necessary. If you have any sort of auditory trauma, watch this on a lower volume if you can. The theater viewing burned my ears.

Otherwise, the story was fine, like paranormal stuff meets The Invisible Man."
