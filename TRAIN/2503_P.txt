Powerful indictment of Conservatism. Blowing up Parliament analogous to "Draining the Swamp" by flushing Trump
England in the movie is clearly what the USA would be if Trump swampies have their way. Fascists brutally attack anyone who doesn't agree with them (see Charlottsville). Scary stuff, but all too real in 2020 when I first saw this movie. Portman is great as always. All the actors really are great. Effects are spectacular. Message is clear in 2020 say no to Trump, right-wingers, conservatives, racists and homophobes..
