Did I miss something?
I feel terrible! Everyone keeps talking about how great this movie is, and I didn't care for it. Did I miss something? I'm serious. I loved the Matrix, but I thought this was boring. I was really annoyed by the fact that V imprisoned Evey, and as upset and ready to die as she was, as soon as she found out it was a ploy to break her by V, all of a sudden she was happy about it? That makes no sense. I'm really interested to know why this movie was so great. I'm not trying to bash it at all. I think I must have missed something. Could someone please tell me what I am missing so I can love this movie too? I was really excited to see it in the theater (and bummed that I had to wait 'til it came to Blockbuster), and then I didn't get it. :(
