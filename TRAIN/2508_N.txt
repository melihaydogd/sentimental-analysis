Cliche
This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the "standard" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.
