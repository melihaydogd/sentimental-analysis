A timeline disaster, how could Queen screw up their own history?
The movie itself is just OK, not spectacular in any way. The lead playing Freddie is too short, too toothy and acting too hard. But what bothers me the most is the history and facts.

They have John Deacon as member of Smile. They have them performing Fat Bottom Girls 3 years before it was written. They have a Brazil concert on TV in 1977 that didn't happen until 1985. The band is shown recording We Will Rock You in a scene set in 1980 when the song came out in 1977.

Did the members of Queen even screen this?
