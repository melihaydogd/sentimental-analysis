Well...It's Not That Good
It was hard not to be biased going into this film. Jerry Bruckheimer has been responsible for some of the worse movies in recent memory: Kangaroo Jack, Pearl Harbor, Coyote Ugly, Gone In 60 Seconds, Armageddon. Nonetheless, the prospect of pirates occupying the bigscreen for a couple of hours was quite appealing.  There, unfortunately lies one of the film's weaknesses: it's too damn long! A half hour of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor...maybe reappearing for the DVD release.  Johnny Depp is brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow...but i'm sure you've already heard that in other reviews by now. Jeffery Rush's performance is also noteworthy, however the rest of the supporting cast is mediocre at best.  Depp is amazing...but that in itself does not warrant throwing down $9 for this movie. Perhaps if you stay in the theater and check another mediocre movie afterwards it would be worth it. Otherwise, wait for the DVD. At least then you have a remote available!
