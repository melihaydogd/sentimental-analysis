WONDERFUL HISTORICAL DRAMA
If there was ever a such a thing as an atheist saint, Hypatia would be it. This movie is a dramatization of historical events. The city of Alexandria was a center for learning. It was said that the philosophical and religious discourse among the merchants and general population in the agora were on a very educated level, that which rivaled the scholars. With the onset of Christianity, the religious discussion changed. Religion was primarily based upon cosmic myths, most of which had lost their original meaning due to the Pythagorean concepts which fused with the old religion creating multiple paradoxes as to generate such debate. Is God anthropomorphic or is God light?

Hypatia was a scientist and philosopher, she is portrayed as an atheist in this film, although her religious belief is uncertain. She may very well had been a pagan. The menstrual cloth she presented to a would-be suitor is recorded in history. The movie is long and at times doesn't move along fast enough. I thought it needed better editing.

Apart from the dramatization, the movie sticks to history. The documentary commentary writing on the screen is white on a predominately white background which made it difficult for me to read with old eyes and an analog TV. I had to pause it.

In spite of some of the films shortcomings, I absolutely loved it.
