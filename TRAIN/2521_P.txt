Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, after watching some really good horror films like The Babadook, The Witch, The Conjuring 1 and 2, and a few other, I went into this film with high hopes. The film didn't let me down. The story is told in short flashbacks that connect to the future storyline. The plot is at time very dark and disturbing. The film carefully tells us about the children's experiences with the mirror and how it relates to them now. The atmosphere the film has is haunting and mysterious. The ending is shocking and stunning. The acting is very good. Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Katee Sackhoff, Rory Cochrane, and Garrett Ryan all perform very well. Annalise Basso, who plays young Kaylie, performs the best in all of her scenes.The pacing is a little slow in the beginning but picks up as the film progresses. The runtime is short which is good.One bad thing about this film is that it is not very scary. I really was never frightened.Pros: Dark and disturbing story, great atmosphere, good ending, good acting, a great performance by Annalise Basso, and a short runtimeCons: Slow pacing in the beginning of the film and the film was not very scaryOverall Rating: 7.1
