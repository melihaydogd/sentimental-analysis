I don't get the story
Before I begin slating and ranting against The Unforgiven, let me make a few points clear. I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and have seen most of his movies. I even like some under-appreciated ones, like The Eiger Sanction. I do not mind lack of morals. A Clockwork Orange is one of my all time favorites. I do not mind cruelty. I am one of the few, who can stand Pasolini's Salo.But I don't get this one. I simply don't get it, neither the first time nor the second one. Why does Munny leave his house? He leaves his kids alone and betrays his deceased wife. Why does Ned Logan leave his house and his wife? I do understand, why sheriff Daggett ignores the prostitutes initially. As Munny and Logan have heard about the reward, he must have too. So why doesn't he just chase the prostitutes away from the town? Why doesn't he take their money? Then why does he get involved, when the bounty hunters show up? Again, I don't get why he risks - and loses - his life for a couple of whore-hoppers.My inevitable conclusion is, that the story s*cks. The characters simply act irrationally. Sure it is beautifully shot - kudos to Leone. Acting is good. So I give it 5/10. But by far Unforgiven does not deserve all those awards. They should have gone to In the line of fire or A perfect World. Probably Eastwood and co were awarded, because the committee felt guilty. Much better movies like Dirty Harry and The outlaw Josey Whales did not receive anything. Alas, two wrongs do not make one right.
