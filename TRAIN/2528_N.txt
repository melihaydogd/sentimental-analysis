Disappointing
Really had high hopes for this film. Greatly enjoyed the acting, pacing, filming, etc.

Then the ending (or lack thereof). Felt like I completely wasted my money.

Yes, it captures the era quite well. Yes, the cinematography was nice. Yes, the suspense was real and compelling.

But you need an ending to a film. Even if you're an "artist." Period.

Maybe they'll go back and actually finish this film at some point. Would be nice.

Until then, a disappointment.
