An experiment Went in Drain
Miruthan, claimed as the first south Indian Zombie Movie directed by Shakthi Sounder Rajan is a bland watch. The film features Jeyam Ravi & Lakshmi Menon in the lead supported by some good actors and lots of junior actors is mix mash-up of the Hollywood zombies like Crazies, Dawn of The Dead, Walking dead Series.The movie revolves around a City Traffic cop who teams up with his subordinate for searching his missing sister when the city was infested with zombie virus.Jeyam Ravi was the show stealer with his sublimed screen presence. Anagha playing as the sister of the protagonist performed well and she was cute and had a good chemistry with Jeyam Ravi. The guy who acted as the friend of Ravi was funny and was good at his role. Lekshmi Menon, as usual playing the lead girl in the movie. Nothing Much to offer. Sreeman was totally wasted in the movie with his boring comedy and facial expression which was irritating (I think he was mocking Jim Carrey by imitating his style)but the story and screenplay was mediocre. The logic was missing in many parts like the antidote for the much unknown disease which is widely spread in a single night which was impossible.Zombies (i think they are not supernatural) are flying whole time. LOL.. What a joke??? And waiting the whole time in front of hero to get beaten up.. Again LOL.. some of the zombies were waiting as a human chain and telling them "guys, wait let the hero perform".. these should have been omitted..The film could have been neatly shot and executed, but the director totally ruined an experimental one which could have turned into a masterpiece. Music was noisy and sometimes D. Imman composed that to give jumpy scares to the audience which was not required for the movie. But the Songs were nice, especially Munnal Kathali and Miruthaa Miruthaa (the song was poorly picturized from my point of view).All in whole, according to me this one is a boring watch ..4.5 on 10 will be my score
