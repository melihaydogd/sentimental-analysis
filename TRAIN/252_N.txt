What in the world is this about?
OK, let's see if I get this right. In a future where the ozone layer has been depleted, a scientist moves his family out to a desert community where he turns the inside of his house into a lush rainforest that proceeds to grow out of control. Meanwhile, his son faces the slings and arrows of adjusting to life at his new high school where he is pushed around by bullies under the command of the sadistic P.E. teacher. Also, government agents who have deemed biological experiments illegal arrive to destroy the house. That about cover it?

There's a pretty neat idea lurking around somewhere in this science fiction/ecological drama/haunted house/love story/teen drama, but it gets pulled in so many directions it just turns into a soupy mess.

In fact, now that I think about it, the only thing that really stands out in my mind about this is a delightful skinny-dipping scene with Laura Harris, the cute blonde who would later star in the also lame "The Faculity".
