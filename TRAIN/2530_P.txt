Open your eyes
Okja it´s a movie about a new especies that is delivered to 26 different places to be raised and 10 years later comeback to a compettition to see who is the biggest one. It shows the history about Okja, witch is one of the big pigs, raised by Mija since she was a child and after the 10 years she has to be take back to the competition and Mija obviously doesn´t want to "give" to then. THis story really open your eyes about the meat industry and the fake advertising that they make. I´ts a great story but the way they tell end becoming actualy a little boring in my opinion, and they could have given more detais about some especific events that make the history less realistic.
