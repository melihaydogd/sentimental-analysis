No character development what so ever.
I mean who were these guys? Im not a fan of Motley Crue but was intrigued to see the story on screen, everyone i know has read the book and ive heard plenty about it in the past. But this movie is just a montage of their 'greatest' antics and didnt tell me anything what so ever about the band, who they were, what set them apart, their fans, nothing. I get that people will be excited to see this but the film really was garbage. I'm guessing it was suppose to be a popcorn movie and not a historical interpretation of their career.
