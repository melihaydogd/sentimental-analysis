Boring Non-sense
It's been 1000 years since humanity abandoned Earth, and claimed Nova Prime as the new home. However, an alien race tried to wipe out humanity by sending creatures designed to seek out people through their smell of fear. One man would lead mankind by having no fear through Ghosting. Cypher Raige (Will Smith) is a well respected leader. He and his estranged son Kitai (Jaden Smith) go on a trip, but they crash land on the quarantined Earth. They are the two sole survivors, and Kitai must seek out the transmitter in an inhospitable land to save his mortally wounded father.

Does any of that make any sense? I don't want to waste my time to go through all the logic loophole the story has to jump through. Apparently these creatures are amazing killing machines, but they just can't see people. And the aliens don't come back after spending so much effort in wiping out humanity. And why is Earth still under quarantine? These are questions that director M. Night Shyamalan would rather not ask. It's rather sad to see such a bright light struggle so badly to write something original. Instead of reason and logic, he starts with a premise and bends reality beyond reason to fit his premise. I'm tired of his non-sense writing now.

What makes this boring is Will Smith. The lack of fear has made Will Smith a mean-spirited robot. After his injury in the crash, Will becomes stationary along with being monotone. I don't know if there is anyway to make Will any less likable or more boring. Jaden is brilliant by comparison. Although he keeps making that face like he's going to cry. He's a child actor and we have to make allowances.

I didn't have much expectations, and it was actually worst than that. I was prepared for boring, but I just didn't prepare for the annoying non-sense.
