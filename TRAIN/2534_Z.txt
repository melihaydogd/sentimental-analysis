Mix of Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption but in very bax way
If you have any info about 80s in Turkey and you are very lazy screenwriter, this is the result. I did not watch the original Korean Movie but this movie is cheap rip-off of Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Movie has very dangerous message about Turkish Armed Forces and antimilitarism. You don't have to watch this movie.
