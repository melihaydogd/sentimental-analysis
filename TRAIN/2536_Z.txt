Brainless but solid action movie
Without a constant CGI explosion overload overshadowing his sense for classic action Bay actually manages to do something solid.

Though the thin plot is full of improbabilities and morally more then questionable, the dialog corny at best, with the Bay'esqe lines of humor merely randomly distributed throughout the movie disregarding script and situation and though the fact that Bay doesn't manage to make you shed a single tear for any of these people one is still constantly on the edge of his seat while the kind of entertaining Connery-Cage duo might get you trough the rest.

Enjoy with popcorn.
