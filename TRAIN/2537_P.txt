Happy movie
The only movie I watched more than 10 times. This fun-filled movie which has the right humor at right time and will definitely tickle your funny bone.

Many guys can replace themselves with our protagonist in one if not more situations. We may find many characters in the movie, familiar with one we come across in our day to day life. In short, movie does not have any superficial stuff. It binds its audience well till the end.

Everyone acted superbly and background's Eels music are very rightly adjusted to the mood of the movie. All in all, a very very good movie with a good message.

P.S: A line from 'Yes Man' "The world's a playground. You know that when you are a kid, but somewhere along the way everyone forgets it."
