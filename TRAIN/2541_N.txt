Incredible Mediocrity
Am I missing something here? When this movie came out last year everyone went on about it like it cured cancer. Well I just saw it on DVD. What is remotely new about this movie? Nothing. It's nice visually, but so what? I thought it was going to be a biting, snide and outrageous parody. Instead we get the same old family dynamics and boring "be yourself" speeches.

A few minor jokes about expanding waistlines do not carry a movie. And frankly, too much action leaves me numb and animated action even more so. The whole idea of the stay-at-home (not to mention incredibly NAGGING) mother was a bit tired. And I thought the black character was really insulting. Was it necessary for him to be a jive-talking stereotype? This movie is for people who actually thought Finding Nemo was good too.
