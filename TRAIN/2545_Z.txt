A few words
I didn't like the movie. One of the most overrated movies I've ever seen! (Although we must pay tribute to marketers and all those who made so much hype around La La Land) You may 'love' the picture in several cases: you're 14 y.o. or so, for you the form is more important than the content, you're a 'fool who dreams', ??? Objectively film has both positive and negative sides (that's why my rating is 5/10, not 1/10), but unfortunately many viewers and even critics were guided by emotions rather than common sence while rating La La Land.
