Fantastic
I really did love this movie a lot. One of the few that I can say really did blow my mind. I was never really a huge fan of musicals but after this, I can definitely say that I am. This movie shows us that if you are passionate about something and you work hard then you can achieve your dreams no matter what. I love this movie.
