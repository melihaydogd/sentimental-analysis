Edge of Plainness
I stepped in the hall with a confidence that i was going to witness a great movie of Tom Cruise after a long time and that it would spice up my holidays....I was so brutally turned down.

The movie seemed to have quite a bit to offer in the starting, its just a regular alien fight movie, nothing we have never seen before. Tom Cruise was great in the movie, Emily Blunt didn't quite convince me, neither did Brendan Gleeson. The story seemed quite dim even during the time loop Tom Cruise experiences and it wasn't a very interesting concept either,maybe it had but wasn't properly executed.

What could have been a masterpiece for a scifi movie lover turned out pretty plain and boring with nothing much to offer.The movie disappointed me in every way, not even the action, acting or the characters could save this 'movie'. Once again, Tom Cruise is great in it, but it isn't his fault the movie is blah....I walked out of the theaters and realized the movie had nothing to offer and had wasted my money.....Being a sci fi fan, this was a brutal let down,and even though i racked my brains trying to find some logic in the movie...i failed. This might be whats called a time-pass movie, and might surprise many video game fans based on the rating I've seen in IMDb. This is Highly overrated......Disappointed in every way. Saw such a bad movie after a long time. I considered Amazing Spider-man 2 and Godzilla to be average movies, but solely Godzilla seemed like an Oscar winning Film in front of EOT. AS2 and Godzilla combined would be a masterpiece in front of this. I wish i watched 22 Jump Street instead.
