IT'S NOT THE BOOK, BUT...
.....It still has a lot going for it, especially Diane Lane.  The book was a non-fiction piece by what I presumed to be was an author in her late 40's. As always, Hollywood must glamorize, and we have a younger heroine who has friends, adventures and romances not in the book.  But the piece IS true to the book in that, sometimes a major life change can bring the sweetest rewards.
