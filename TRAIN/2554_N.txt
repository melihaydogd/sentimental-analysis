utter garbage
Two stars for CGI. If they could have replaced the actors with CGI, I'm sure they would have done that too. Too bad computers can't generate a plot.

Going in, I thought perhaps the poor reviews were due to the disconnect between the legend of King Arthur and this modern take. Not so. When people say "there's no plot," this is not an exaggeration. There's also no character development of characters that are already flat as a board. The acting is good of course - I wouldn't have seen this if it didn't have some great actors in the roles -- but they have nothing -- worse than nothing! -- to work with. 

To add insult to injury, Arthur himself is the modern anti-hero that 12-year old boys are drawn to. The fact that he hoarded money is supposed to show us that he has potential for power (ummm, what?). His character is moronic and selfish, and imagining this man being a legendary leader makes my head hurt. Folks, try this exercise: instead of it being a beautifully sculpted blond young man spouting those lines, pretend he's an aging, balding man with an unattractive face and a potbelly. Does the character still shine through? (It's sort of like they took watered down lines that got rejected from Deadpool - a movie I love, btw - and popped them into this script).

Don't waste your money. Seriously, you'll regret it. I never write reviews, and this is how angry I am that I wasted money seeing this trash.
