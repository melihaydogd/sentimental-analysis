Boring...yawn
I was looking forward to this movie...I was intrigued by the main character...

Little did I know that I would be so bored...

Oh...how amazing the main character is...beating up so many men! wow...impressive! yay...girl power!....

It's like the main character becomes a charicature of herself...The movie tries too hard...and everything becomes mechanic and dumb...its just scimming the surface without any realness to it...no in depth.

Im very dissappointed...
