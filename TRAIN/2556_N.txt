Wow...
How are we supposed to take a character seriously when she has the emotional depth of a drunk toddler. Cass acts so unbelievably stupid in the days after the murder. It's also unbelievable that every person in Cass's life wouldn't think she killed that guy. It takes until 15 minutes into the second episode for Cass to make a good decision, she then immediately starts to make bad ones. This show insults your intelligence at every single turn. I'm out.
