Oh well
"Eat Pray Love", is of pretty thin substance for some of us real grown ups.

One wonders why Julia Roberts at 43 hasn't reached adult status as of yet, but maybe she will in a few years, a few more films ahead.

However I have to say some of the acting was better than expected and other parts including those with Bardem lacked any semblance of real or mature independence, but the whole subject matter and story reeks of immaturity. Speaking about her ex-husband, "We were immature and too young to get married and fell apart". Oh well. Traveling around the world to seek enlightenment and soul search ain't going to fix that Julia.

In this case the movie is actually childish when I'm looking for some solid content in a film rather than to see Julia's dependency, rebounding after her husband and, "fixing", herself in new relationships with at least two other men and a couple of, "could have beens". It's a bit disappointing to what the film might have been. None of it had to deal with emotional growth and Julia is too old to play little girl parts. The Neil Young tunes are always welcome but his wisdom expressed through his lyrics was far ahead of anything this movie offered.

I enjoyed the wonderful settings in Rome, India and Bali but I'm sorry, I'd recommend this to 15 year old girls as what not to become. In the U.S., such spiritual enlightenment as the film pretends to work up to is simply called maturity, and the film lacks this development.
