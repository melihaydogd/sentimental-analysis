Yet another boring superhero movie of marvel
I really do not understand why people are liking this movie. Yes it is better than the last CAPTAIN America movie, but it is as boring as THOR 2 or IRON MAN 3. Stupid Plot and unappealing action sequence followed by melodrama at the end.I give up. I don't think marvel movies are worth watching any more. The first half of the movie is a bit intriguing. But the second half of the movie is very boring. Even the end credits scene is boring. The worst thing about the movie is that i had no prior idea about the plot or even the new characters like "the winter soldier" but i could predict most of the things that were going to happen next. the storyline is really weak. As soon as any mystery resolves you feel Man! this is stupid. You feel disappointed on most of the scenes. The only thing worth watching in the movie is Scarlett Johansson(i am not talking about her role. it was boring as well). Her dialogue delivery is impeccable. All in all another disappointing stuff.
