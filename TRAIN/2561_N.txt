Utter tripe, thanks to Natalie Portman
Now, I don't usually have it in for films as much as this one, and indeed, I thoroughly enjoyed to work of the rest of the cast, but Natalie Portman! what was she doing? I've seen balsawood give better, more nuanced performances than her, and what was going on with that accent? Evey is meant to be a working class girl from inner city London, with an estuarine or cockney accent, but half the time she sounded Australian, and the other South African! she continually managed, throughout the entire film, to single-handedly wreck ever single scene she was in! Even V, with that Guy Fawkes mask had a less wooden face, she comes across like a plank of wood mistakenly cast into one of the movies most pivotal roles, nary a worst bit of casting have I seen.
