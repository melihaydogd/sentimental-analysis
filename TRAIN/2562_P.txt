Best Sci-Fi Movie in this Decade
I enjoyed every second of Edge of Tomorrow. It's really funny, breathtaking and worth the money. Tom Cruise by far is the most underrated actor and he's the reason why I wanted to see this fantastic movie, along with Emily Blunt who did a great job in her first action role and let's not forget the late Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant Farrell. Edge of Tomorrow is a great sci-fi movie with unforgettable moments that'll make you want to see it over and over.
