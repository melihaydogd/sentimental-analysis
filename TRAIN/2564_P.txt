Relatable, Real, and Heartfelt

Bill Burr and Pete Davidson are an amazing duo. I know this is not a type of movie where they would have a part 2. But I would throughly enjoying watching this story continue on with all these characters. It was a little long but you would really feel the emotion between Bill and Pete.
