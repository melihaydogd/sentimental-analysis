A stupid mess, and it didn't need to be.
I walked in thinking this was going to suck, but I was surprised that it immediately seemed way better than I expected. The actors were all great, and the characters were good, except the girl (and I can't figure out what she was even doing in this movie). There was some actual funny dialog. So now you just need to blow some stuff up and it's done, right?

No. It started out entertaining and just got more and more painful as it went on, until in it melted down in a mentally deficient mess of convoluted sewage. How freakin' complicated does this story need to be? The hard part was already done, just pull off the mission and go home, everyone's happy.

And the AWFUL editing and shaky camera work gave me headache. I was thinking I hadn't seen an action movie this badly shot and with a story this unnecessarily complicated since "Smokin' Aces", and what do you know, it's the same guy. This movie is 10 times the movie Smokin Aces was, but that's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

This director really needs to be stopped before he becomes the new Paul Verhoeven.
