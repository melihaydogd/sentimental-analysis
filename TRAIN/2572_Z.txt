Shows the ignorance of Hollywood
Historically inept, amazingly biased and overall terribly ignorant. I have come to expect nothing less from Hollywood's less than amazing historical epics.

Poor acting doesn't usually help but in this case, at least it gives the film some humour. The exaggerations of English EVIL and Scottish pride sickens so much that I am beyond retching. The film goes nowhere towards motioning that the Scottish invaded England constantly in their spare time, this is the reason for England invading and taking over.

I'm surprised the king of England didn't have a hump. The next step on from this is to show hoards of Englishmen burning babies for a living then going home smacking their wives having a cup of tea and going to bed in a bowler hat.

Thank the sweet lord that Hollywood has better films than this.
