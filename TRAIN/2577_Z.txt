Nothing special... perhaps okay if you want a brainless action movie.
This movie had a lot of potential to be a masterpiece. Sadly, it came cliched with the same action sequence and course of events, that have been going on since the 90s. After perhaps mid way through the movie i sadly lost interest, it just seemed that it was a very simple action flick with a very straight forward story and blunt characters. There have been some really great action movies recently like and I was expecting either a action sequence something like "Extraction"or a great story. I must say I am a little disappointed when i saw the movie after the trailer.
