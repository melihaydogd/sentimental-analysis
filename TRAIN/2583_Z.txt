Confusing...
I was really looking forward to watch this movie since the Bosnia war is such a present event and I still remember articles and news footage form the conflict. The beginning is quite promising and the plot seemed quite simple and interesting (even though done a thousand of times before, I think for all wars possible) but after the first violent shot I started to get confused and the story got quite boring with plain flashes of free violence that I guess were there just to shock the viewer and cover the lack of depth of this movie. It was very disappointing and rather violent with no sense and mingled in a , maybe, attempt to be original and to cover something you know nothing about.

It left a sense of emptiness and also exploitation of a such recent war. Maybe keeping the original language instead of forced English would have helped a bit but I doubt that. I am really surprised that a woman had the courage to direct this and place such a display of nothing.

This could have been a wonderful story and instead is just a festival of shocking images and moments that after a while get tiring and predicable.

The end was quite surprising and there again with a meaning of nothing.

This was probably the worst war- love movie I have ever seen and 127 minutes of life I could have used to do something more interesting.
