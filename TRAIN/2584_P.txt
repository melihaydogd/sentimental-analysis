James Earl Jones as a Zulu type warrior!! It's amazing! Henry Silva's bad guy, could whoop Skeletor's a$$ right outta town.. Sharon Stone is sexy, AND cute as all heck. Mistress of the dark Elvira, as one of the two, equally VERY beautiful queens - wow! Richard Chamberlain is awesome, and comes across with a charming, glowing faced, well skilled, well groomed TV star quality that yet, unlike other TV "heartthrobs" has a genuine interest, and adventurous fearlessness that makes the whole film seem so - natural! Classy, well rehearsed/scripted action scenes, lots of VERY cool, absolutely beautiful, well filmed locations, and tons of really cool extras in the film. A very interesting, captivating, and adventurous story that's not at all pompous, and it has a fair dose of charm, heart, and some pretty funny moments in a unique, and quirky way, with great characters that are almost a modern videogame style mashup, and are extremely loveable, discernible from each other, and notable.

If you like movies like - Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, National Treasure, and say things like, Brendan Frasier, or Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson style adventure movies and the like - You WILL definitely enjoy this, and moreover, this is probably a film that most people have not seen, or heard of. It's great to find something new, that is old - and considering the genre's limited profile of movies, this film is far more than worth watching, if you really do enjoy them.

Is this a Michael Bay, or J.J. Abrams film? NO. Shine a flashlight into a prism at your eyes while you watch this, and it would be the best one ever. It's a far more epic film, than first glance might give it credit for.

It's a great family film too.

I think this movie, is amazing :)
