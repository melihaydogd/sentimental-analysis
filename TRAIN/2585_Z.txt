Enough with the sarcastic with...
This movie was very well-written. I'll give it that. The writer obviously spent a lot of time on it. It was, however, incredibly pretentious and completely in love with itself. I will bet my bank account that no high school kid in America talks the way the main character did. You're constantly being bombarded with sarcastic wit. At first it's pretty funny but this movie went completely overboard with it. Halfway through I thought to myself "Hmmm, a gay guy must of written this. Only they could reference this much outside pop culture and extraneous, irrelevant information.", and whaddaya know? I think in the midst of trying to make so many pop culture references he forgot that he was actually tasked with writing a structured movie because the ending felt pretty rushed and the conflict resolved too easily. Oh, and having the unconventional, hip parents was such an original idea, and funny too. The writer watched Juno way too much. The bottom line: If you're a woman aged 13-55 or a homosexual, chances are you'll LOVE this movie. If you're a couple of normal, average, unsuspecting guys just trying to be entertained on a Sunday through Netflix on Demand, you'll be severely disappointed and the only positive thing you'll take away is that you got to see Emma Stone in lingerie and acting slutty. Actually, this is the one redeeming quality it has for all of the guys out there. Definitely worth watching just for that reason. Just put it on mute.
