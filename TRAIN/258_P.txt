Not as good as "Twist and Shout" but close
Danish coming of age story. Bjorn and his buddy Mulle (who is cheerful and immature) start to become friends with Steen who is a big bully. Steen has a horrible home life and takes it out on everybody else. He pulls Bjorn and Mulle into more and more dangerous situations...and it all ends tragically.This came before "Twist and Shout" but was released in the US after (because "Twist..." was such a big hit). This was good but not as good as the later film. The characters aren't as well-developed and the situations Steen pulls the boys into are disturbing (and unbelievable). Also I thought the ending was far too sick for any coming of age story. Still the acting was good and it's not a boring film--just pretty depressing. Beautiful closing shot too. Worth seeing--but see "Twist and Shout" too.
