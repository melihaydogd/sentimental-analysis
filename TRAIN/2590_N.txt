collosal fail
Short and simple: story/plot is very bad (makes no sense, stupid); the characters of the story are underdeveloped or development of them is non-existing, most of them have the same trait in common - not damaged by intellect; Overall acting is ok;A bit more: Too many things in this show just don't make sense or are contradictory and don't blend. In fact so many things seem to be nonsense or just plain stupid that it makes the show utterly annoying, not to mention the irritating piano theme music. Many "plot" twists seem to be made in a way that you would be telling a made up story on the spot and some ways into that story you just make some stuff up about characters that would let you develop the story further, for example - "Did I mention that (someName) is also an undercover spy and because of that (somethingHappens)". Most of the characters portrayed as simple minded, what would give them the chances to reach the positions in life they are portrayed in the same as winning a lottery. I think watching this is actually slowly turning brains into mush. The reason I'm not rating this 1 star is because I recognize the work that was done to put this thing into production.
