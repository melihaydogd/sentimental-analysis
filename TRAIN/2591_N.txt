Didn't expect a lot, got less
With such well known actors and actresses I just didn't think they could go too wrong. Before the end even the actors seem to have given up. Maybe it's there was no where to go with the story line so it got too absurd or maybe they just got tired of pretending they could save the movie at all. I really felt like every actor in it, save Joel Kinnaman, gave up halfway through. Still I did watch until the end.
