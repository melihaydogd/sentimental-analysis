What happens when you combine Alien and Rambo
There's just something about 80s action films that gives me joy. Sure, they're testosterone-poisoned macho blasts where grotesquely muscled men use big guns to shoot anything that moves. But they're so honest about it that it becomes endearing. They're like that one jock friend you had, who you'd expect to be insufferable, but who turns out to be surprisingly humorous and kindhearted dude full of good cheer.  Case in point, Predator, starring the manliest man who ever manned, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Who likewise turned out to be surprisingly humorous and kindhearted individual. In this film he plays Major Dutch, the leader of a mercenary group sent into the jungles of Central America. The mission seems to be going well, until something something starts hunting him and his men. Something not from this Earth.  What I like in this film is how it goes straight to business. Here's the setting, here's the mission. Go there and start blasting. Honest, straightforward, pure in its over the topness. And when the film transitions into a horror film, it's pulled off well. The character of the Predator is one of the icons of action horror cinema for a good reason.  The special effects are surprisingly good for late 80s, albeit not perfect by any means, and the final confrontation between Dutch and the Predator is one of the best action set pieces of the decade. And that's a stiff competition.  Still, it must be said that Predator is not a perfect film. Personally its flaws don't bother me at all, but objectively speaking I can see how its mindless violence, macho culture and linear storytelling might bother some viewers.  But in the end... dude, I'm here for the explosions, the dakka and the gore.
