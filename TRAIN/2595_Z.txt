A great cast on a so not great movie
It has all the elements of a romantic comedy: the witty lines, the handsome, cocky leading character; the girl, the geeky friends... However, "Failure to launch" fails to launch. They try too hard at being funny, for example, all the animal-related accidents? one scene about it was enough, but they repeat the same kind of scene 3 times in the movie, making it so predictable it's boring.Nevertheless, Zoe Deschanel saves the day by bringing in amazing, original lines that have you laughing in almost every scene she's in. Her character Kit is just adorable and hilarious, in contrast with Sarah Jessica Parker's Paula, who's stereotypical and clich√©d...All in all, it's fun to watch Failure to launch, although I doubt it ever becomes anyone's favorite.
