The Emperor Has No Clothes SPOILER ALERT
Maybe I am the first one to say this but this movie is god awful. If I could give it a negative rating I would. I don't know when directors got the notion that a long movie makes for a good movie. Whatever became of good editing? I fell asleep watching Leo DiCaprio limp through the snow for 2.5 hours. Sure it's a tale of fierce determination, but really, it could have been told in 90 minutes with no loss in quality or character development. I feel that the movie was horrifically bad and would present a strong cure for insomnia. Out of mercy's sake, I would volunteer to jump into the movie and shoot him dead; to put him out AND the audience out of misery. Please note this is not a death threat but only an improvement to the waning plot. The movie is incredibly Hollywood-predictable to make me laugh out loud, even if it's based on a true story.SPOILER ALERT: In retrospect, if I saw this movie again, I would root for the bear. Hopefully the academy has some sense and realizes that they should not agree that this is good cinema just because that's what everyone else is saying...I say that the emperor has no clothes!
