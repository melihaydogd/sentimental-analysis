Fantsatic movie
Well what a class this movie is. hahahaah. Seen it several times. Grandpa(Castallneta), has a vision in church. Homer(Castallenta) adopts a pig and calls it Spider Pig. It turns out to be a disaster for the community. hahaha. Homer dumps Spider Pig's "waste" or as Marge(Kavner) refers to it as "leavings" into Springfield lake, even thou the Mayor of Springfield, Mayor Quimby(Casltealnna) has called a "Code Black", ie calling all Springfield Residents to stop dumping in the lake. However Homer fails to listen, and costs Springfield its life. So how to save it, first the family flee to neighboring(so called - hahah) Alaska. Then they see on the News that its to be bombed to make way for a new Gorge. So the family get caught by EEPA EEPA, EPA.

I do appreciate the way the movie kept some of its TV series like Bart writing on the Board of which it says"I shall not download this movie", fantastic.

So overall a fantastic movie.
