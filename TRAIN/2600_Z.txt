Caruso The Generic
Let's try to go back to 2008. We got "Eagle Eye", It's a mixture of various sci-fi flicks. Now we have "I Am Number Four". Yeah it's based on a book, but everything you see is familiar. I just noticed most of Caruso's sci-fi movies have clichéd ideas. Is it the writer's fault? Some of the dialog is also generic. The special effects looks so homemade(look at the lasers). The actors have murmur problem. "I Am Number Four" is underrated in a bad way.

If the nine aliens are so powerful, why can't they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I've never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence.

The action scenes? Well D.J. Caruso is good at one of those, but here it's messed up. The special effects is so inferior it felt like they used Adobe After Effect(except those giant monsters but still looks cheap). The effects ruined the action of this film. Clashing unreal things and look at those colors. The lasers.

The performances? Alex Pettyfer thinks he's cool but he's obviously not. Teresa Palmer is hot but she only kicks ass in the third act. Timothy Olyphant was disappointing. A pro actor playing a boring guardian.

Overall "I Am Number Four" is as lifeless as "Twilight"(sequels). Or more lifeless I guess. The action scenes could have been better. The characters thinks they're cool and awesome. They are dull actually. The rest is cliché. Generic. Etc. Is it worth watching? No. How about skipping the first and second act. The third act is the only entertaining part of the movie. But I'm warning you. It's an easy generic forgettable film.
