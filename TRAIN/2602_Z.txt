Surprisingly disappointing...
Honestly, all factors were indicating a favourable outcome here. Even though many of us inevitably feel that most products and stars churned out by the Hollywood movie system are most kindly described as formulaic.

Personally, I have a fairly neutral opinion of Mel Gibson as a brand. Despite this, my expectations for Braveheart were in line with so much hype. As I have a fervour for history and cinema, the combination is oftentimes one I find especially interesting. Braveheart had a headstart.

Well, it was a very pretty little 'historical' tale. Otherwise, this is a seriously overrated and predictable flick.
