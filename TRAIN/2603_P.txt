Endless entertainment
I can't believe Director Wolfgang Peterson made Das Boot, The Neverending Story and Enemy Mine as three films from his career that he made back to back. Three entirely different films and each a gem. Most people commenting on this here saw this film as a child and have cherished memories from the eyes of a child. Many other cherished the book and have disappointed reactions to the the film's adaptation. I have neither. I had never heard of this film in it's theatrical release and never heard of the book. I saw it first as an adult about a year or two after it's release when it showed up one day on HBO or Showtime or one of the movie channels on TV. I found it absolutely charming and entertaining. The next day I had to see it again. I found it so intelligent and visual that I watched it for a third time a few days later. I've seen it a couple of times since then and have always liked this. When it's sequel NES II came on TV a some years later I checked it out but turned it off shortly after. I didn't want a bad sequel to sully my image of this fine film. I love the music in this too, especially it's title song. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10 and recommend it to young and old alike.
