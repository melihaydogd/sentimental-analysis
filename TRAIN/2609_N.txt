Just wrong.
This movie has some serious issues. The biggest spoiler was the fact that i watched the trailer and thought this might be a good movie. I am sorta right most of the time, but in this instance? Totally off.

Meant as a nice action flick, it lacks the kick. The story itself is not new, but has often made a good movie. Yet there we walk into the first flaw: The script is miserable. Reality goes over board after about 10 mins. The ideas on the movie are so ludicrous, it hurts. Even this is not a definite problem, if the movie wouldn't take itself so serious! I was laughing at some moments about the insanity i was faced with.

Second: No, Shia LaBeouf is not good in this movie. His character is just so bland, there is hardly anything to do for an actor. If you'd meet Jerry Shaw on a party, you'd excuse yourself after latest 5 minutes of smalltalk. Same goes for Michel Monaghan, no wonder her character is a single ma in this one.

Third: The action is all cut in MTV-0.3 second-shots with shaky closeups and confusing longer views. Yes, this is trendy now, but the movie pushes so hard for action, you can almost see the fireworks being squeezed out of it. It goes boom, but i had a hard time to care about. Instead i often had the urge to fast forward, but sitting in a cinema, this wasn't on the menu.

Seriously: I want my money back. Big cinema is going down? Well, stop making such boring movies.
