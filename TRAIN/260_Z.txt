Stolen file
I watched Ringo Lam&#39;s city on fire and I was upset to see how Quentin stole everything from it to make Reservoir Dogs, Yes I like the way he combines different movies to make one but reservoir dogs was like an American Version of city on fire with white actors (not in a bad way).<br/><br/>I know it has been said before, but I recommend you to watch City on fire, things that didn&#39;t make sens or if you don&#39;t want to waste your time listening to those tough guys talking about what they did, City on fire will just show you what happened in a small box of time.<br/><br/>But anyway, I think Mr Blond and Pink made it look pretty though.<br/><br/>I am sorry, just in case he paid for the rights.
