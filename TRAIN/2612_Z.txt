One of IMDBs most overrated movies
Batman Begins is one of IMDBs most overrated movies. Don't get me wrong, its still a great movie, and its definitely the best Batman movie out there. But it has nothing to do with IMDBs Top 250, and sure not with the Top 100 ... It COULD have been if the whole movie would have been as great as the first half of it, but from there it starts to constantly destruct itself. It fades from a movie with a deep, great story (and also great storytelling) to that what you expect from a movie that's expensive like that: a summer blockbuster to fill the cinemas. You can't do that without big fights, big explosions, big pictures. So the movie ends up in a simple action movie story ... and when you leave the theatre you are sad because you know this movie could have been so much more than it had been. The strenghts of Batman Begins are mainly the serious story, the placement of the movie in a realistic and not fantastic environment, and the first part of the movie which tells us how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. It's not only a movie for Batman "fans" ... everybody should see it. It's really good - a good summer blockbuster. But don't expect what the IMDb rating of more than 8 stars tells you ... its not that great, by far!
