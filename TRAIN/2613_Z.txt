I used to love Rambo
Rambo Last blood has just about the worst dialog I&#39;ve heard on film. The sets are unimaginative, the acting mostly terrible (Stallone does a fine job) and the young girl is clearly way older, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s all bad.<br/><br/>The violence had me in absolute amazement, I laughed a lot at the absolute brutality of it. It was so damn funny satisfying. Stallone isn&#39;t breaking new ground here. But he is really convincing as a psychopath.<br/><br/>It&#39;s an odd end to the series in all honesty. If Rambo 4 felt unnecessary, this one feels like it shouldn&#39;t have been made. Still, it made me smile...and cringe.
