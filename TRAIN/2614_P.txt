Stunning performance from Jake Gyllenhaal
The first half of Prisoners is incredibly gripping and powered by some stellar lead performances and magnificent cinematography. Gyllenhaal is comfortably the standout, turning in arguably his career best performance. It's all too common to see these aloof sullen detectives suck the life out of a movie with excessive dreariness but Gyllenhaal gets the balance between sombre and compassionate just right. Sadly though, the writing is a bit of a letdown and we are left with numerous unanswered questions and directionless subplots. To be honest, I'm still not quite sure what actually happened and how events unfolded. Everything felt a bit sloppy and incomplete, not to mention the film ran way too long. Well worth watching but a messy ending stops this from being a genuine masterpiece.
