Didn't like it.
This movie had some redeeming qualities, but I basically didn't like it. I'm not very familiar with anime, so maybe that's part of the problem. The animation seems to be choppy, unlike Pixar movies where the characters move in a smooth manner. Some of the scenery was wonderful, but the choppiness of the characters took away from the beauty of the scenery for me. Also, the fantasy part of the story was just plain weird for me. I understand the "Alice in Wonderland" reference, but in that story, we still have animals and people as the strange characters. In "Spirited Away," there are strange characters that don't seem to make sense, for example, the witch's baby. How does she have a baby and why is he "huge?" Other parts of the movie didn't make sense. Why does the father suddenly drive his car very fast up the hill just before stopping in front of the stone statue? Why is the fantasy world suddenly surrounded by water? It's a little too strange for me.
