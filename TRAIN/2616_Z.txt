Good battle scenes, but plot is ridiculous and film is too long
This is a World War II film about a group of soldiers who set out to find and send home a soldier whose brothers have been killed.The battle scenes at the beginning are very good - but that's the only good thing about this film. The plot is ridiculous - the army wouldn't devote soldiers to finding and bringing home one ordinary soldier - no matter how many people in his family had been killed. The film is far too long and a lot of it is slow.
