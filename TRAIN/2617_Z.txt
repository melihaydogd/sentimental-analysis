An OK movie if you enjoy British humor...
For the most part I do not find the very dry, insulting, and abrasive humor of Great Britian to be very funny. Most British comedies (and I use the word comedy lightly) are anything but funny. Monty Python is no exception. The vast majority of the movie is slapstick and dry. However, there are a few really great lines that come from this film. If you have some time to waste and want to see the only Monty Python movie that is worth wasting your time to see, then watch this one. However, should you miss this film the only thing you will really be missing out on are the constant repeating of the few good lines from this film by other people you know.
