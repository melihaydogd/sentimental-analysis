I am surprised
It was better than I expected. The story offers all: adventure, revenge, pain, love, nice pictures and suspense. The photography was very fine. I discovered this movie in the US Box Office when it was launched and I was surprised by the high cumulative gross amounts. I find that this is the best remake ever made and I recommend it to everyone who likes films of Napoleon BonaparteÂ´s time. The film is very clear directed. Congratulation to Kevin Reynolds and to the actors Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce who did a very great job. The act of revenge was similar to the one of "Gladiator"; another masterpiece to not miss. I will add this one no doubt in my best of dvd collection. 8/10.
