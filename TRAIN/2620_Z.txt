A confusing action thriller.
The Accountant is an action thriller directed by Gavin O Conner and stars Ben Affleck as the titular character, with supporting performances by JK Simmons, Anna Kendrick, Jon Bernthal and Jeffrey Tambor. With a cast like this is it really wrong to feel a tad interested in this film?

The movie is about a freelance accountant that just so happens to work for some of the most dangerous criminal organisations around, add the fact that he is on the autism spectrum and you've got yourself an enticing character who is pretty much what the entire film is revolved around.

The character of Christian Wolff has a lot going on in his life, and coming into a movie like this you would expect to get a glimpse into all of the aspects of himself. Unfortunately, I feel like that is all we get in the end. Just a glimpse into the different sides of this mathematical genius.

I really did expect to see more than what we got. I understand that with a character such as this it is difficult to convey his different sides in depth, but that knowledge doesn't change the way I felt during the movie.

Another problem I had was that the movie felt like it was trying to be different things at different points. At one stage it's more of a psychological thriller studying how autism has affected Christian and the way he lives his life. At other points it's an action thriller about an accountant that works for the wrong people and has training that equals the level of Special Forces.

This is just how it seemed to me, but I'm just some random on the internet, take my words with a grain of salt. On the plus side the acting is all good enough to warrant a watch at the very least.
