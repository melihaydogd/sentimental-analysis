Nightmare Nun
The nuns dark atmosphere and eerie tone make for a near perfect entry into the conjuring franchise. The camera work is great and with very little use of cgi, it makes the film feel even more dark. One things for sure, the nun will give you nightmares, so whatever you do, don't stop praying.
