If you're a self respecting woman, RUN!
This movie started out okay you see Ron (Matthew) engaging in some "risky" behavior. There were a few funny parts showing how crazy his character is but when he gets some health news you do start to feel for him. But as the movie goes on you're bombarded with naked females and not just a flash of boob but enough to make this self respecting woman walk right out of the theater. Nobody should go to a film and feel degraded like that. If I could give this zero stars I would. I feel this movie had great potential but took it way too far. There needs to be a line drawn in how females are treated in films today. I'd give a more detailed review but left pretty early on. I had had more than enough. I wish I could get my money back.
