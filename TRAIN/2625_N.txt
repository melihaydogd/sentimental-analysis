 Overrated
Whew. Maybe if I had never read the book and didn't know what the tale was supposed to be about, I could have sat through this film more patiently. But to me it seemed overlong and overblown and rather far from the *spirit* of the original work. I am not a slavering Tolkeinist (no offense meant -- trust me, there are other things I am a slavering -ist of ), so I didn't need a word-for-word transcription, but I was disappointed.
