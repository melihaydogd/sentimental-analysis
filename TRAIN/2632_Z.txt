Surprisingly conventional
Modern animated features have often been marked by profound ruminations of life and death &#39;Toy Story&#39;, &#39;Madagascar&#39;) or by hip references to popular culture (the &#39;Shrek&#39; movies). But &#39;Ratatouille&#39;, this year&#39;s smash hit, it by contrast a very conventional animation, a straightforward cartoon story inspired by the simple pun that gives the film its name; indeed, it reminded me in some ways of &#39;Wallace and Grommit&#39;, although (obviously) without the northern English flavour. I liked the animation of France (Citroen D-Seies included) and Peter O&#39; Toole is very funny, voicing a snooty restaurant critic, but I think a chance was missed to make the rats as physically repulsive as most people find them in real life; a cuddly rat is sort of missing the point. And overall, I found (as an adult viewer), the same joke stretched a little thin by the end of the film; a film where a woman shoots up her own house to kill a rat (as happens early in this movie) is not one to encourage dark thoughts about the nature of life.
