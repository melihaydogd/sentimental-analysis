What a Year!!
As a big Stallone fan Rocky/Rambo i cant tell you how many times ive watched his films, this film has no actors, for the first time ive seen Stallone not even try to act, and in doing so destroy this films legacy, this film could have been escape plan 4 the amount off effort that was put in, i can see why the original writer was disgusted at this shame of a film, its like a bad rambo clone, a straight to dvd wannabe, i would never tell anyone not to watch a film, im sure the camera crew worked hard, a sad decline of a great franchise
