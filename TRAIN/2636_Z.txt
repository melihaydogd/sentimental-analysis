Two Words: Very Bad
Nothing but formulaic drivel. There is only one surprise in this whole movie, and that involves a missile and a stadium. Everything else is unbelievable and unbelievably stupid. I fear for our nation's safety if our best soldiers (the Navy SEALs) are the idiots we see here. I fear for the future of entertainment if so many people consider this a good movie. Avoid it like a Michael Jackson concert.
