An average and typical Marvel film
97% Rotten Tomatoes. Really? Critics have gone mad or been paid a descent amount of money.

It has no special story, and the plot is totally predictable. Colors and visuals are the only gorgeous parts of this film. I felt cheated after how amazingly Black Panther was shown in Civil War.

It has been released in 3D but there are merely a few shots that felt good in 3D.

Overall acting is okay; no actor leaves their mark on your mind. And as always, this Marvel movie too suffers with the villain deficiency syndrome.

6 out of 10 from me, that's it.
