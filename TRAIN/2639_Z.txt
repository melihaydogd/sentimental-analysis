A Tense Thriller
Its hard to come by effective horror/thriller movies these days, and I'm glad I came across this one. The scares were properly spaced out and effective, the direction was tight, and the child actor was a bright spot in the film. Add good performances by Bacon and Seyfried and you have a small, but well-balanced cast.

I also liked that the isolated location added to the sense of dread built up during the movie.

Side note- Kevin Bacon seems timeless! He has been effective over a wide range of genres and films and does not disappoint here.
