It was okay.
Being homeschooled and a christian growing up in a very humble lifestyle and household, I appreciate the message they were trying to get across in this movie. You grow up with so many restrictions and when you're out of that fearful environment it truly is a wake up call. Knowing that people have been doing what you have been forbidden to do for years and they are alright. I like seeing movies like this where I can relate somewhat to the plot. It wasn't really amazing or the best movie I've seen but it was a good message I think. I have absolutely no idea why it was rated R since it was pretty tame for what else comes out these days but maybe I'm wrong? Anyway I loved Natalia Dryer, even though she's well in her twenties, she can still pull off a teenager pretty well.
