New York City, Mall Town
Enjoyable but totally off the beaten path film, which might be why i found it so likeable. Gets kind of old seeing the same old crap with different titles if you knw what i mean. Besides, I am a complete sucker for almost any road film. Its a bit on the rough side, language, and the sex kind of pushes the envelope, but for some reason it really brought me back to my days of living out in crazy LA.
