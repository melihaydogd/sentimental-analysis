Disgustingly Bad
Probably one of the worst animations released in 2009. Just boring, clich√© riddled and unoriginal. The animation takes story lines from all action films, mainly Mission: Impossible, and adds nothing new to the mix of already recycled material. What's the worst offense, however, that G-Force commits is the quick cash-and-grab, meaning that parents will most likely take their kids to see this atrocity of a film but get absolutely nothing out of it.

Extremely quick to forget the boredom that this rubbish film put me through. I would find it hard to believe that even the youngest of viewers would find this good. Parents beware, if you are taking your kids to see this you may want to stay behind or wait outside the cinema playing on your phone, because that would be way better than suffering through this.
