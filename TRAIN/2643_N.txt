Invulnerable people punching each other..,.Yawn

Can't believe the high IMDb score on this one to be honest. I was very disappointed with this film. It starts off OK with Krypton, and the early part on Earth is OK-ish, but about half of the film is one long moronic punch-up. Invulnerable people hitting each other seemingly endlessly does not a dramatic encounter make. Superman gets punched, flies back into building which is demolished. Gets up as he's invulnerable. He punches person who punched him, who flies back into building which is demolished. Gets up as he's invulnerable. Repeat for 2nd half of film. The next film I viewed was Watchmen. The comparison with such a rich packed storyline just threw into sharp contrast the wasteland which is the Man of Steel script.
