failed potential
This could have been a funny movie, but it wasn't. More capable hands might have made it work. This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. I can think of at least that was worse; if memory serves me correctly, that one also starred Arch Hall, Jr.

The movie was full of demeaning ethnic stereotypes. Why foreign spies would run around wearing their native costumes, I have no idea.

There are a couple of halfway decent performances in this movie, or it may be that they only seem that way because of the atrocious acting they are surrounded by.

One of the few pleasures I received from watching this misbegotten movie was seeing the cars the spies drove. I once owned and have fond memories of a car similar to one of them.
