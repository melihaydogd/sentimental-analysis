One of the better sci-fi shows I've seen in a while!
I never watched The Expanse while it was on cable but finally started watching it after hearing so many great things about it and boy am I glad I did because it's one of the better sci-fi shows I've ever seen! I'm so glad Amazon picked it up and continued the show. It's even better now that it has a bigger budget!
