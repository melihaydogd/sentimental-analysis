full of dreams
This movie is about a jazz musician, an actress and their romance. There are many scenes of singing and dancing and good this film is good for people who love performing arts. But the most important theme ,I think, is LOVE. When it isthe love for sounds, it is music. When for theatre, it is acting. When for a person, it is romance. And through the love, the 2 character grow up and purchase their dreams. This movie inspired me into loving acting and standup comedy. When you love something , that could be your dream. Ill recommend this to everybody who love something and who wants to love something.
