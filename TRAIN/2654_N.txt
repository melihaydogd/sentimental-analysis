The Worst
I like Anna Farris and the original Overboard, so we decided to give this a try. I lasted 24 minutes before I couldn't watch anymore... this sucks SO bad. The first one was silly, but Kurt and Goldy got away with it in the original because of their chemistry. And the obvious stretches at trying to be a "woke" version of Overboard was super-awkward - I feel embarrassed for anyone involved with making this carnage. If you haven't seen the original, watch the original!
