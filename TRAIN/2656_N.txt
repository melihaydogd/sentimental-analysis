Independence Day meets Groundhog Day...not in a good way
The special effects are good, the aliens are...well, wonderfully alien, but the story relies on time travel and the repetition gets monotonous and you pretty much can guess how it is all going to end.

If these aliens are so smart they can shift time, what are they doing invading planets like Earth. The convoluted logic as to why Tom has to keep repeating the day is so shaky it ruins the plot.

I figure I am not adding a spoiler since the movie was renamed to add "Live, Die, Repeat" to the tile Edge of Tomorrow, just in case you didn't quite get it.

Always looking for good sci-fi movies. Unfortunately this is not one of them.
