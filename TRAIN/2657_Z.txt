Good for laffs
If you want to see some big name Hollywood actors make a total fool of themselves check this flick out. The movie is so bad you will want to see it all because it gets worse as it gets to the end. And then the end will have you rolling your eyes and drooling with laughter because the budget for this movie must have been outrageous and it was all 'for what?'.

The setting is a fancy Alps resort where the wealthy go to be treated for the aches and pains and frustration that comes with aging. The principle characters are Michael Caine who is a retired symphony orchestra composer/conductor, Harvey Keitel who is a washed up movie director, and Paul Dano (the only young one) who is an actor studying others for an upcoming role in a movie. Ninety percent of the movie is Dano eating, Caine telling everybody no, and Keitel obsessing on his swollen prostate gland! There are peripheral stories here but these three are the main characters.

Caine refuses to perform an orchestral piece he wrote for his wife as she was the only one who could do it to his liking and it was written for her only. Well old QE2 wants a command performance of this piece and the only quality in the Caine character is the fact he tells her absolutely not, he will stick to his principles and QE2 can just suck it up. Well you know what happens!!!

Now the best scene is the cameo appearance by Jane Fonda! She plays a brief scene made up as an angry, bitter, old drag queen movie star and she's damn good at it to!

This flick is strictly for cocktails, treats, and a movie night at home! The only thing going for this movie is it's lush photography.
