Great Book destroyed by horrible Screen writing.
First off, the opening scene with Will Smith is just one long advertisement/commercial for the Ford 'Cobra' Mustang. (Which was nice) Second, lets get into the writing of the film with the virus; Will Smith says after the capture of a live zombie that 'the Zombies have lost all Basic Human instinct because a male zombie steps in front of the light when he captures a female zombie' which the writers make look like if it was the Zombie leader's girlfriend. 3.Will Smith can knock out this zombie with one "pistol whip" yet the zombies tipped his car over by bashing the side with their heads. 4. Next all the Zombies are not capable of rational thinking yet the set up a ironic trap to capture Will in the same way he captured the girl. 5. There is one zombie which is the leader of the rest of the zombies, because he is able to think and command? If it is a virus it should be able to infect everyone the same, and don't give me this nonsense that a virus can give you super human strength and make you mouth bones extend to twice your size. 6.Then the END this is a major spoiler so if you haven't seen the film just stop reading. THE END OF THE FILM is a joke. The butterfly lady with her son get into fireplace metal door and she clearly say there is enough room for him. Mean while the Zombies are smashing at the window. He could of very simply got the frag grenade that he so idiotically martyred himself with, and hid with his body in the fireplace with his head and arm out and thrown it the moment they broke through and quickly got inside and survived. So many other stupid little thing annoyed me like the dogs and the main zombie holding them and stopping when they reach a 2 foot wide sun-ray and will smith getting bit in the neck and the end and thrown against walls, downstairs etc. and nothing happens to him. the only thing that made this movie bearable was the BOB MARLEY music.
