Almost Too Painful to Watch
There are films one watches simply because there are a lot of famous people in it. There are films we watch because the story is a classic, and we like to compare it previous versions.

If you're watching it for the former reason, you won't be at a loss for finding famous faces. If the latter reason compels you, don't bother.

This long, heinous exercise in ego masturbation is one example of how one actor can take himself too seriously. Kenneth Brannagh, a highly regarded British darling, stars as Hamlet, a role far too young for a man of KB's age to play. His over-the-top portrayal of the Prince of Denmark would probably have been perfect for a huge stage production, but seems ridiculously hammy, even in this lavish setting.

If you want a good laugh, watch Gerard Depardieu's cameo scene. Utilizing this beloved French actor in a scene that clearly displays his lack of English skills, it's hilarious to watch him him repeat over and over "Aye, my Lord" and "Yes, my Lord," especially since he obviously doesn't understand what Hamlet is saying to him.

I hate to admit this, but even Mel Gibson's Hamlet surpasses this one, if only for the fact that it's more to the point and easier for younger students of Shakespeare to comprehend.

If you want to see Shakepeare works done well, watch Ian McKellan in Richard III. Do your best to skip this film entirely, unless you want to make a drinking game of it.
