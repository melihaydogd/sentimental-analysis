Terrible
Where do I BEGIN? The violence and the language were appalling for a series finally of movies that didn't have anything like that in the previous movies . I loved Deadpool, so I am not offended by such things, I just think that it was unnecessary in a Wolverine movie. But beyond that, the story was ridiculous and boring, not to mention the lack of explanation about what happened to the rest of the X-Men. XMen-3 was finally corrected in DOFP, only to have this piece of crap come along!
