May, Trump And Putin Would Not Be In Power If The World Had Watched This
Much has been said about the genius behind the script and ideas of V For Vendetta. They are all true and speak to the power of cinema when done with intelligence and purpose. I would like to note the amazing action, entertainment, realism and most of all the acting as well. When one compares the acting in V with films like Star Wars The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi or any of the silly Marvel films it becomes so evident that there are actors and there are actors in this world. A film can be replete with special effects yet the actors could be deeply stirring. The elite hate this film. The working class, the citizen, the human will love it.
