Pure Beauty
As a person in an intellectual field, stating that my favourite movie is Dirty Dancing does not come with kind looks. I, however, have never been more mesmerized and taken by a movie before or after this one. Everything is perfectly placed and the subtle details entwined in the major scenes are excellent: I will always consider the car scene after Baby and Johnny's dance at the Sheldrick to be one of the most masterful cinematic scenes in film history.

But, alas, all Dirty Dancing fans know that the only reason they watch the movie is for the last scene. Everything building up to it is necessary and, consequently, moving . . . but that scene leaves me breathless and goosebumped to this day.

Do not avoid this movie because it is seemingly a superficial teenage romance. It is not; on the contrary, it is a beautiful picture about life, hardships and of course, love.
