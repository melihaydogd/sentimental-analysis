It's Rambo. That is all it needed to be.
This movie is everything it needed to be, and whether or not you like intense violence is obviously going to differ person to person, but yes, this movie is bordering on a step too far. Which is awesome. i loved every second, its pretty much a movie that was built for fans, not critics.<br/><br/>If you love sly, and love rambo, this is the movie for you. Absolutely disgustingly violent is how i would describe it. The critics were always gunna hate a movie about a white guy murdering a bunch of mexicans, because its &quot;offensive&quot;. Take critic scores with a pinch of salt and youll have yourself a great time at the cinema with Rambo, one last time.
