Sorry I just kinda got bored halfway through
I feel obligated to mention I didn't finish watching this one. There's no plot or anything. There's like 10 of these Baseball players living in a frat house essentially. They don't get into hi-jinks really. Actually the only hijinks I guess is this 5 minute or so scene of them getting kicked out of a bar because one of them is rude to a bartender. It's chuckle funny but not like break down hilarious and a big "Fight" breaks out but somehow no one throws a punch they just kind of wrestle around until the bar tenders throw them out. Actually now that I think about it most of the film feels like sort of softcore gay porn. Do they make softcore gay porn? I'm not homophobic or anything just describing what I'm seeing it's just a bunch of hot guys talking about their penises, sort bland partying and occasionally a man wrestle breaks out. I could see finishing it if any of the characters had a subplot. I think you're supposed to be following this quiet shy perfect gentlemen jock(cause those exist) whos pursuing this "smart" girl, but that literally just materializes about halfway through. At that point I just stopped caring.

This movie is definitely for somebody. I hate to give it a 1 just because its not for me. Gotta go figure out if softcore gay porn exists now. I swear this is it.
