Watch the originals - even Thunderdome was better than than this rubbish

The only reason it gets 2 stars is for the visual effects - and I very nearly deducted another point for the waste of $150m on them...

The whole movie is pointless action - no plot or story line, acting is barely passable although to be fair they weren't given much to work with, ridiculous waste of resources that are supposedly scarce (think Waterworld), pointless violence and continual unrealistic feats make this one of the biggest flops of all time given the budget.

This movies adds nothing to the original trilogy, in fact even the worst of those movies - Thunderdome - had 10 times the charm of this tripe.

Watch if all you like is constant visual effects and car chases, if not steer well clear and watch one of the originals instead
