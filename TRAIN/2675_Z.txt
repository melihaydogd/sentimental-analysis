And I ran...I ran so far awayyyyy (at least that's what I wanted to do with this movie)
The best part of the movie is Emma Stone's cute little quirky dance to the I Ran song, trying to get back at Ryan Gosling's character. After that it goes downhill for me and it just seems like every other rom com/musical I've ever seen.

I gave it four stars for that scene alone. That scene definitely should have won an Oscar.
