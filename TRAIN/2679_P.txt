A 70's classic.
In his second and last collaboration with Sidney Lumet, Al Pacino give a amazing performance as a bank robber who don't planned his assault very well, actually do not want to harm anyone and reveal himself as a bisexual.

John Cazale also give a very good performance in one of his last films as a accomplice of Al Pacino character. The film transmits extremely well all the anguish, fear and fatigue of all the characters from the main until the supporting, especially in the parts that are fun. Charles Durning also gives a brilliant performance as the man who tries to bring balance to keep the negotiations between the police and the robbers.

One of the best performances of Al Pacino and one of the best Sidney Lumet films, Dog Day Afternoon is one of the best films from the 70's.
