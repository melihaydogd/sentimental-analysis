This film is flash with no substance
This movie is total flash with absolutely no substance. Potato Chips for couch potatos. The stylization is flat. It would seem from the other reviewers that if you find a bunch of 1930's outfits and cars that your movie is now "stylized". And what's with Kim Basinger? The big shoker is that we see a photo of the detective kissing a prostitute on the floor with all her clothes on? Oh my god! I can overlook a few plot and motivation flaws (there were many in this move), but what's the big payoff here? An ending riddled in cliches. This movie has all the empty calories of a can of Pringles. I'm mystified at positive response people gave this one.
