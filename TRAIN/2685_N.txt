Painfully bad

An incessant car chase movie written by people who obviously have no understanding of vehicles, engines, physics, or anything related to entertainment. They weren't even talented enough to write much dialog to offer up any trace of a story (there's very little speaking, and complete sentences are downright rare).

I can't believe this mess gets any good reviews at all, let alone the amazingly high IMDb ratings it enjoys. The only place I can see it belonging is Saturday afternoon on the SyFy channel, along with all their other dreadful ultra-low budget crap. Hollywood seems to have entered an age where the quality of a screenplay no longer matters. Endless special (or not-so-special in this case) effects are supposed to substitute for an engaging story and characters with depth. I mourn the loss of creativity -- it must be very depressing to work in the film industry.
