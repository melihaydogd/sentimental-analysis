Worse film I've ever seen
I can honestly this is one of the worse movies I've ever seen. It's so annoying it's untrue. It's not funny, and it's attempt at being funny is cringe worthy. The character is so annoying and comes out with childish jokes that only an idiot would find funny. Constantly making cock jokes just screams out the immaturity of the movie. I can honestly say I didn't laugh once through the movie and was just getting more and more anoid at how crap the movie was and was questioning what I was doing with my life .

The plot has about as much substance as a pre ejaculation, there another cock joke to go with the movie. Ryan Reynolds is annoying anyway, and this movie has made me border line hate him. I will never watch this again and definitely won't be watching the sequel. 

Save valuable hours of your life and stay away from this complete waste of a movie. It's truly horrific .
