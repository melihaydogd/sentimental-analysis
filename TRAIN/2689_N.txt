This show has gone off the rails
The first couple of seasons were great. Then the CW does what they do best, ruin shows with P.C. crap.The Flash isn't the Flash anymore. It's now the Iris show. Flash is on screen for small amount of time while Iris runs around in the starring role.Thanks for ruining the Flash CW. I'm done and hopefully this show is canceled soon.
