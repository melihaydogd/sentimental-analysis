The best atmosphere of the punk-scene i´ve ever seen
One of the best movies in my collection, and it is a big collection. The actors are bad, but they are punk-rockers. I don´t know, why no one knows this movie in germany, because it is real interesting and strange. In most parts it is even better than the standard Hollywood-stuff with ridiculous actors like Jean-Claude van Damme or Robin Williams. It is really a good buy, if you are interested in the music of The Sex-Pistols. If you are not interested in the music, you also should buy this film, because you will make an experience.
