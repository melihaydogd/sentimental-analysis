The Movie That Made Me Love Movies!
It always amazes me when someone tells me they didn't like this film or that they thought it was creepy. E.T. was the first movie I cried at in the theatre, was the first movie I remembered everything about, and the first movie that felt personal. As an 8-year old in 1982, I was suddenly becoming aware how much growing up without a father was making me different from my friends. I was alienated and alone at times, seeking my own identity that little boys often find in their dads. E.T. made me realize that I wasn't alone and that love, compassion, friendship, and family could still exist even if my father didn't want me. The movie is beautiful, inside and out. EVERYBODY delivers a meaningful performance with heart and dedication. If you haven't seen this film, watch it, and be prepared for an emotional roller coaster that ALL great films should have.
