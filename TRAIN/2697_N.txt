WHAT WAS THE POINT?
I love QT films but this was soo boring, was waiting for the movie to start after 90 minutes, this can have 2 stars because the end scene was good, that's about it.What was the point in this film? There was hardly a story line, what was the point in Margot Robbie's character? The whole film was an anti-climax.All that needs to be said, if this wasn't directed by QT, this would no-where near get the hype it has done, it would be classed as awful, simple as that.
