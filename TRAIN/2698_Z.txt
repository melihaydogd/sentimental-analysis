Am I missing something?
I made an Imdb account just to leave this review. I was so excited to watch what I've heard many refer to as "the greatest sci-fi film ever made". The only thing keeping this from a 1/10 is the visuals. The atmosphere is great, dystopian Los Angeles reminds me of a vivid terrifying nightmare-scape. Besides that, this is one of the most flat and empty movies I've ever seen. The pacing is never more than a crawl, we are given no reason to care about the characters, and it has the worst quality a film can have: it bored me to tears. A statement could be made that it is not great for its entertainment value, but more so for its philosophical commentary on the future of machines and AI, but the film did an awful job at that as well! I haven't the slightest idea what I'm supposed to have taken from this film. If one enjoys this for the nostalgia factor, go ahead, but if you're new to sci-fi, do not watch this

Too Long Didn't Read: Great visuals, dull and uninteresting script and characters will bore you to tears. Perhaps the most overrated film in sci-fi history, proceed with caution.
