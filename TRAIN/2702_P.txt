Go have another adventure..
One of the funniest and most touching Pixar/Disney movies ever. It was certainly filled with unexpected surprises and moments.Solid story which had great atmosphere and writing. The characters are likable. You got the main character, Carl who is going through tough times and had good development. You got Rusell who is a well rounded character and has his own quriks and personality. And some of the side characters such as Dug and Kevin. The animation was pretty good and the voice acting was great.Overall an enjoyable movieMemorable: No Rewatchable: Maybe
