Mime from Hell...
Future flavours and concentrates abound for epic movies that would appear a decade or more later in various superhero franchise and still do. It's also riven by Noirish elements of some years precedent and consumes a significant measure of Goth/Punk music culture and stylisation e.g. The Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie Sue, X-Ray Specs and Gene Loves Jezebel, none of which would have looked out of place on set. Shows its age a bit now but the themes are perpetual.
