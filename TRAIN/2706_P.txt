Beautiful and realistic
I don't normally like musicals but this film...wow. This film has such strong meaning and music. The music is just beautiful, "City of Stars" and the main theme the rolls around in the scene of the Planetarium or at the ending just take your breath away and it hits you right in the heart. In my opinion, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have solid performances, maybe Emma Stone with +1 over Gosling but still both of them very solid and a big respect for Ryan upgrading his piano skills for this role. Both have nice and beautiful voices but again i will give Emma Stone a +1 over Ryan Gosling. What i really liked is that, even though the movie is sad in the end, it is very realistic how lots of people separate because of their dreams and it's real shame, but some find happiness and something better and new. It is a really lovely movie.
