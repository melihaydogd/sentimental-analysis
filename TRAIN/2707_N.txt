Nothing original
I am a fan of good cartoons and my 7-year old son and I saw this together. Unfortunately, there's nothing really original in this movie where the plot is the usual one, with a bad guy who wants to rule the world and a happy ending where the frustrated and controlling party -the mole- is brought to reason without inflicting too much damage. It barely seems to be riding on the originality of previous movies such as the good fellas being unusual (guinea pigs instead of the "Ratatouille" rats) and at least 2 scenes resembling Toy Story (the pigs escaping from their children owners and the car chase where the skate board is replaced by a futuristic 3-ball vehicle). The only interesting (not new but "refreshed") idea is that of machines attempting to control the world, but the "coffee-machine" is really used in one scene only. So OK, the visual effects are sometimes impressive, but technology does not do all in a movie !
