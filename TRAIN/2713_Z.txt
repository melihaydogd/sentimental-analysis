I personally find the first Matrix movie a little overrated. It's not a bad movie, I would just recommend other sci-fi movies before this one. The premise is the film's strongest point. You are so intrigued by it that you have to see how this could possibly end. It does lead to some very exciting shoot outs and special effects, and Laurence Fishbourne's performance is something to be said about. Yet, it feels very muddled at times, like you get the feeling of "What did I just see?". Keanu Reeves is actually not as bad in this movie as one might think, but it's passable when compared to Morpheus. All in all, see it if you want to, because other people have much better things to say about it than I do.
