Disjointed and vague
Some really good acting by Costner, RIP, Beth and Rainwater. Scenery stunning. General story was engaging but that's where the good bits stopped. Characters introduced for whatever reasons and then gone before they got a chance to say Hello. From Jaime and his plastic hair to storylines that started in the middle but never got to the end. I did a lot of head scratching trying to figure out what the hell was going on. A lot of the stories seemed to be made up as they went along and then someone seemed to have a better idea and introduced a new plot, scrapping the old one. It vaguely started telling you the outline but never ever went into proper detail. e.g. The Beck brothers - Surely Billionaires have body guards and get them to do their dirty work e.g. The native Americans story seemed to be a token sub plot. KC and his wife and Jaime were about as convincing as a bull using a knife and fork. It had the potential to be excellent but failed miserably. I would love to remake it and give the characters much stronger scripts.
