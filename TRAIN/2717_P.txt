One of the very best sci-fi movies ever
If you like time-traveling movies, this is the movie for you. Because there is no better one. Neither Looper nor Predestination or Interstellar. Edge of tomorrow has mind-blowing action and effects, a fantastic story, it is incredibly funny without being a comedy, and all actors do a great job.

Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are amazing, it is one of Tom Cruise's best movies. Bill Paxton plays a sergeant and he is perfect in that role, he is hilarious. Brendan Gleeson plays the general and he is amazing. Isn't he the guy who played the father of that teen girl of "28 days later"? I recommend watching that movie twice because there is so much going on. It is a must watch movie.
