Did I miss something or this movie actually sucks?
I was quite excited to see Tarantino's 4th movie. I love his previous work! But this movie really sucks, big time. Here's why:

I guess the script can fit in one or two sheets of paper, cause besides from the fight scenes, there's nothing left but a bride trying to have a 'revange' for her murdered wedding day, husband and son. SO? That's not enough to make a decent story; not a 90 minutes one!

Fight fight fight, blood blood blood, swords swords swords. Big deal. Millions of japanese and chinese filmakers have been doing that since who knows when! But even when first Bruce Lee's movies sucked, it was really stunning to see him move and fight. That was the magic! But why did I payed to see this blonde chick fly with cables attached to her waist, fighting against 88 'Katos' at once? This movie just don't make any scence!

Now the good part, here is why its not the worst movie i 've seen: a very small portion of that dark-humor Tarantino's got... its always appreciated! The actresses are really gorgeous! The photography is quite nice with all those bright colors and contrasted combinations. It has some interesting colorfull scenes and camera movements (very creative! but a movie's not made out of that). And the music is great.

The only part that's amazing n' great is the Anime scenes. Those are really great.

But more amazing than the disappointment of this nonsense, bloody, stupid movie, was to see the ratings it got in this website. Whats wrong with you people? Will you applause to everything the media tell you to applause? Or is it just me, who didn't get something? maybe Its not that Tarantino's trying to make a fool out of us; maybe the whole movie was actually a dark joke and its just me who didn't get it.
