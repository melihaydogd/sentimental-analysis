Not a perfect movie, but a movie with some aspects that are perfect.I don't think this movie is perfect, but in many ways it comes very close. On the down side, I do think it was too long. There were many scenes I could imagine being shorter by 30 or so seconds without losing any effectiveness, and one or two scenes I could have done without. That would have brought the running time down by about 10 minutes. There were a few lines, a few plot issues, and a few bits of acting that were below stellar. Finally, there were a few technical goofs in the CGI--obvious green-screens, or poorly done physics.

That said, the rest of the movie--the other 2 1/2 hours that don't contain any of the nits I am picking above--are a masterwork. For starters, every moment of Kong is pitch perfect. The CGI is masterful and the movement is sublime. Kong's eyes express more than some of the other actors! And to say again, although there were other moments of below-grade animation, every bit that has to do with Kong was absolutely believable and incredible.

And Jackson is without a doubt a masterful director. The score was magnificent, the cinematography was beautiful, the performances were all good and in sync with one another. All in all, a fine example of the craft of movie-making.

I don't give the movie a perfect 10, and not even a 9--I would have liked a tighter plot and a little more pulse-pounding for that. But I do give it an 8.5 and still feel that that is high praise. A movie absolutely worth seeing by practically any kind of moviegoer, and an absolute must for aficionados of special effects.
