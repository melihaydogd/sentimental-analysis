Forgettable
Okja Well that was a letdown. The guy who directed this is usually an outstanding director/writer. I'm not sure just what happened but this film is the type of film you will forget about in a week. You'll probably end up watching it again in two years from now because you will literally forget you ever watched it. It was just poor execution. Poor use of the talent but most of all just a bad script. Looking back at it.... ahhhh! This film doesn't even deserve a complete review. It looks pretty but has zero substance. I'm only giving it 4 stars and not two stars because it does actually have a great soundtrack.
