Just as TV started to go downhill...
Let me just say that I was very skeptical about this show. Judging from the sneak peaks and previews, I assumed this was going to be just another family guy/ Brikleberry lazily animated show with some cheap and low standards. Well gee wizz, I was very very wrong! Rick and Morty might seem like some stupid knock off of Back to the Future or some money laundering scheme as part of late night cable TV, but its not. Behind all the jokes, each episode surprisingly has a strong message and whether you can relate to it or not, you won&#39;t really feel like the end of each episode was a bummer.<br/><br/>The weakest aspect is the animation. Its not pretty and seems out dated. Despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. No, not even one bit. The absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon. <br/><br/>Unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable. They aren&#39;t just there as fillers and they are nearly as important as the main story. In fact, in most episodes its hard to tell which one is the sub plot and which one is the main plot.<br/><br/>What I&#39;m trying to say is that this show is near perfect. What are you still doing watching new Simpsons and Family guy, go watch this show if you haven&#39;t already. Its a great example of how TV hasn&#39;t turned to total crap.
