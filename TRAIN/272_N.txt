Wow, a movie about gangsters cussing and waffling on, BORING!
This movie just bored me no end. It was so painful to watch. The direction by Quentin Tarintino was terrible and the actors were very miscasted. I watched this with my friend and he also thought it was terrible. Nothing to admire, no action, just cussing. There&#39;s no point going to the message boards saying that you don&#39;t like it, because if you do people at the message board will use anything as an excuse for you to love it. &quot;If you don&#39;t like it you don&#39;t get or you&#39;re an idiot. It was Quentin Tarintino&#39;s first film, go easy on him.&quot; Don&#39;t let tall this get in the way of your opinion, because this movie was stupid and pointless. Very predictable too. So I wont even say anymore.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone who loves Quentin Tarintino. By the way, I find Quentin Tarintino overrated, everything he does people think it&#39;s great, but it&#39;s not.
