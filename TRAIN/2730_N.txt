Don't Bother
I watched this last week because I do believe Lilo does have some acting skills that were shown in some of her earlier work.

Anyway, I wanted to see if this was as bad as people said.

Okay, this is even worse than "Just My Luck". That occasionally managed to be humorous in some places. This is so bad that I can hardly believe anyone would finance it. The plot and premise itself could have been interesting if there was a rational script. The actors themselves performed well enough but nothing could save the movie, not even the pole dancing scene in the strip club. In fact (and I can hardly believe I would actually write this) the pole dancing was probably the most tasteful scene in the movie. (Yes, I am female and resent the way female sexuality is generally depicted in films---so now you know how awful the film really is!) Is it really necessary to show decomposing limbs in what is supposed to be a mystery? I watched the entire movie hoping, expecting it to improve as it progressed. Well, it didn't! I think the producers were trying to show how a crime victim mentally processes and remembers a horrific experience that no human should ever have to experience. Also, perhaps, how society perceives female sexuality. I do appreciate the attempt because it is so difficult to understand if you haven't had that experience yourself or experience the restrictions the culture still places on female sexuality--the virgin/whore good girl/bad girl mentality. Sadly, this film failed to do that.
