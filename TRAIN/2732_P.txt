Great Movie.
I thought this was an amazing movie. It was very well put together and put out an amazing message about how media lies to sway peoples idea about what goes on. Also it shows how people can come together to go against a totalitarian authority and defeat them without fear. This movie reminded me a lot of the book "1984", the movie "Wag the Dog", and the movie "Loose Change" about 9/11. It showed how the chancellor tried to cover up what was really happening by feeding lies to the public, which the publice did not buy. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a film that makes you think about our govt and if these kind of things really happen, we just don't know about it... Great movie, one of my favorites.
