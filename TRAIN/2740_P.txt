Hey, still one of the best
This one isn't quite as good as Empire, but close.  It shows how cruel Jabba really is, shows Leia in a skimpy outfit and shows the climatic space battle at the end of the movie.  Sure the Ewoks might be cheesy, but go ahead and watch Phantom Menace and tell me who's less annoying - Jar Jar or the Ewoks.Ten out of ten.  I'd give it like a 9.5, but IMDB doesn't get that accurate.
