This is an excellent movie, why didn't it receive an Oscar
This is the most enticing film I have ever watched. A true master piece displaying the true artistic integrity of film. The underlying themes of a monotheistic society exploring the themes of Christianity and the teachings of the lord. A true masterpiece that really is a work of art and one of the most fabulous film I have ever witnessed. Nicholas Cage has a Masterful performance as Speckles and should have won best supporting actor. This film is ground breaking in the way of unconventional story telling. I love this movie, it cured my depression. Thank you Hoyt Yeatman, beautiful film, 10/10
