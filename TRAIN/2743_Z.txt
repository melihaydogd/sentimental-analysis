Disappointed with King Kong
Way too long. Animation and special effects were good, but in some areas really looked fake. We (myself and my teenage nieces) were wondering how Ann maintained her good looks, dress intact after being man-handled by a giant gorilla, dinosaurs for what seemed to be a life-time. It was exactly the same with the other characters. I am 40 years old and haven't seen the original version in many years, however, if a giant gorilla was going to be brought to NY city from a far away island...uncharted...my recollection is that the original was probably more believable. Some of the acting also left a lot to be desired.

We all found it somewhat painful to watch, as every other scene with Ann basically showed the same painful expression on her face. Some of the animated scenes might be too much for little people.
