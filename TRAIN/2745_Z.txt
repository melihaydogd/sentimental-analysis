A slow tale
I understand the intent of this film, and it did touch me. However, it was a poorly edited film. The introduction and several scenes in it were left too long, and without reason. Too often you feel you are living his life at real speed- and while that could be powerful and helpful at times in connecting you with his life- it was used too often and without reason.

Not wanting to give spoilers to those who would like to see this visually impressive film, I warn you to look for a slow paced long afternoon to see it. Be prepared to get only the standard challenge ("live your life to the fullest!) from this movie of the heart. Without a real climax or crescendo this film made you feel every moment of its nearly 3 hour run time.
