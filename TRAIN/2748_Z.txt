like a gentle glass of wine
Leisurely, romantic and nicely written 'finding a new life' story of a writer emerging from a seriously bad divorce and, on impulse, buying a house in Tuscany. This will hardly keep you glued to the screen if you feel your attention wandering, but it has some lovely one-liners and may appeal to the nomadic and literary nature within you (if you have one). Frances (Diane Lane) starts a new life and is engagingly wooed by several Italian Lotharios. It isn't cheesy, but it isn't particularly deep either. I would love to retire to Tuscany, amidst the vineyards and olive groves, fireflies at night and the smell of summer between the sudden downpours - I just can't imagine Diane Lane there.
