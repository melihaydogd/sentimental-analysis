The Story is Interesting; The Movie is Boring
This is an interesting story. Researcher files his conclusions. Company fires him. Researcher talks to reporter. Company goes after reporter. Eventually, story gets out.

This is a boring movie. Crowe files his conclusions. Company fires him. Crowe is sad, sad, sad. Crowe talks to reporter. Crowe is sad, sad, sad. Company goes after reporter. Crowe is sad, sad, sad. Story gets out. Crowe is sad, sad, sad.

I know that this is supposed to be based on fact, and Mr. Wigand is alive and well. Nonetheless, I was really rooting for Crowe to blow his brains out. It would have helped the movie, and it would be the only thing that would get the audience cheering.

Hopefully the real researcher, Jeffrey Wigand, has working genitalia, because Crowe obviously does not. Either get a pair and talk or get a pair and shut up. But holy crap, don't sit on the screen for 2:37 and just mope around like a lost little doggie.

Unless you can enjoy Al Pacino act like a tough man in a non-tough man role, you won't like this bloated "feel bad" movie. It deserves to be a segment on 60 minutes, but not a movie.

Very interesting story that is very poorly done.
