SWEARING SWEARING SWEARING NOT A FAMILY MOVIE
I watched this due to Netflix' certificate of a G (guidance) As soon as the swearing started I was straight on the net and found that the BBFC had certified it as a 15 !! GREATI had my 5, 9 and 13 year olds watching it.Switched it off. Very disappointed. No need for the profanity AT ALL.All the trailers I'd seen prior suggested a family movie. I knew the MEAT thing was involved. But Beethoven was gonna be used as a gun/bullet test. So wasn't concerned.It was the profanity that got me to turn it off.I can't see who the movie is aimed at? It's a CGI cartoony pig hippo. That kids will love and teenagers will laugh at how cheap the cgi is and that their game systems are far superior.Totally mis-aimed in my opinion
