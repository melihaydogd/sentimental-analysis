Don't waste your time!
A lax, uninteresting film. Of course, what else can be expected from Kim Basinger. Kevin Spacey fans will be disappointed. There were times when I didn't think I would even make it through it. I am in the minority though according to IMDb's user rating. I give it a 2 at best. Watch Primal Fear instead.
