Good and Bad but overall disappointing
I'm going to make this quick and to the point. the dialogue is very jumbled. The writing sucks to be honest because it is so very cheesy at times. Natalie Portman makes me very uncomfortable her acting and role in this film is just awkward. This entire film seems very rushed and overdone. Overdone in the sense that there was so many unnecessary parts that did not add anything to film. Wachowski brothers seemed to be on a quest to convince us of this whole idea when we were right along with them the whole time. I appreciated the idea. I think it's great with the government and control but Natalie Portman with a shaved head and some of the things she did and wore made me cringe in my seat with embarrassment. At one point some people in the theatre started to laugh. But do not let me discourage you. I think it definitely has its moments but i still am left questioning the point of certain scenes, characters, and subplots.
