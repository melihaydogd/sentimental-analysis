I don't get the negative reviews
This is right on par with Marvel. You need to look at this like an extended movie. As the episodes go on it gets better and better. I'm so impressed with the acting here! Wyatt Russell has been fantastic in his role, especially in this latest episode! Daniel Bruhl also has been awesome! I like that we see more drama and sorrow with Sam Wilson and Anthony Mackie has done awesome at exploring that. Sebastian Stan once again shows how great he is at expressing without words. The first scene in this newest episode was both heartbreaking and beautiful and I too my hat to him.I'm looking forward to the rest of the season and I am just confused by the reaction on here. The first episode was slow, but it has picked up rather quickly. And you cannot compare to Wandavision! It's a totally different type of show.
