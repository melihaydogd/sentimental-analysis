Completely Unrealistic
Easy A seems as though it has been written by a bunch of old farts or people from a small town that have a very closed-minded outlook on the teenage years and highschool. It is annoying to watch this movie as a teenager and no way relate to it, and it is completely misleading to adults. The plot was very absurd in itself and pretty uninteresting other than a few unexpected twists that were completely random and had no foreshadowing or evidence to go with them. Overall, the writing was just poor. It was funny at many parts, though, and the character development of Emma Stone's character was somewhat good. It is not worth going see at the movies or renting, but it may entertain you if you're bored. Props to Emma Stone, though, for giving this movie something.
