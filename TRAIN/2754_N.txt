If only Bullock would have died in space in the first 5 minutes....
Over paid A-list actors playing themselves in a ridiculous plot were the audiences only hope is that they both will die quick and they can listen to the wonderful music and stare out at the stunning visuals of planet Earth. How did Sandra Bullock get this role? Would it be her intelligence? eh...........Or her intensity? eh................ Perhaps her dazzling skills at dramatic cinema? um swallow.

She was plainly trying to recall what she did in 1994's Speed with Keanu Reeves. If only Bullock would have died in space in the first 5 minutes....

Come on man.
