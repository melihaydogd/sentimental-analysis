Its lost its Base story along the way
Loved the original series and the 2 films that followed were also acceptable and i enjoyed them both , but what this is isn't the Equalisers story or character. i feel they would have done better giving it a title of its own rather than one that has a following and a fan base, its not even close to what i expected , its by far the worse adaptation of anything i have seen for the last couple of years.
