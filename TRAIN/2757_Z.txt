Visually Stunning, Bland Story
I know, I know, I'm such a weirdo for not loving this. I wanted to, I really did... but I just hated the storyline. I couldn't empathize with either of the characters and found them both to be kind of unlikable.

However, this movie's visuals and choreography are brilliant! The colours and dances were so fun to watch. While the music was... meh (not a huge fan of musicals), everything else was really cool and well thought out.
