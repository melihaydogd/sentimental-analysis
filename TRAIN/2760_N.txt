A Telemundo Soap Opera On The Big Screen
My wife and I enjoyed the original Overboard, and watch "Moms" on TV so we thought we might enjoy the remake. If you love Telemundo, and the Soap Operas they show, you might like this. I rented the disk, and glad I didn't waste my money watching this at the theaters. No way compares to the original Overboard. Only watch this if you have nothing else to watch!
