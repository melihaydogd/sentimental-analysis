Joan Bennett Is Worth Waiting For
Beautiful lounge singer Joan Bennett (as Brenda "Lucky" Bentley) marries racketeer businessman George Raft (as Steve Larwitt). The two are blissfully in love, but his criminal past spells T-R-O-U-B-L-E. Thinking prison will protect Mr. Raft from rival gangsters, Ms. Bennett helps the F.B.I. put him behind bars. But, she tearfully regrets it when Raft is sentenced to ten years at Alcatraz. The frame-up is engineered by Raft's sneaky aide Lloyd Nolan (as Slant Kolma), who wants Bennett for himself. She rejects Mr. Nolan and rents "The House Across the Bay" from Alcatraz, to be close to Raft. Enter Walter Pidgeon (as Tim Nolan).

Producer Walter Wanger does a wonderful job showcasing bride Bennett in this crime thriller. Bennett is stunningly presented, and acts well, too. Others in the cast are also very strong, but it would have been nice to tie Mr. Pidgeon's aviation character in with Raft's somehow - perhaps as a wronged business partner or old acquaintance. Boozy blonde Gladys George (as Mary) lends notable support. Director Archie Mayo and photographer Merritt Gerstad do an excellent job - the three prison meeting scenes are marvelously staged - with help from assistant directors Charles Kerr and Alfred Hitchcock.
