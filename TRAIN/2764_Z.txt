Bizarro Neo
Greetings again from the darkness. OK, the trilogy is over. Neither of the sequels stand up to the fascinating and ground breaking first, but despite the script flaws and oft-lacking dialog, all three stand as tremendous action/special effects movies. Revolutions tries to tie up the loose ends regarding purpose and especially death. Keanu and Carrie-Ann are off screen for way too long during the battle to save the dock. Hugo Weaving, as Mr. Smith, is again both entertaining and frightening, but he also is off screen for extended periods. Jada Pinkett Smith looks great, but could have probably pulled off her role in the last 2 without the hours of training. She gets to flaunt very little of her powered-up body. The best movies rely on the story and characters. The Matrix trilogy began with an interesting story and screwed it up. Its best characters were there til the end, but somehow we are left unfulfilled. The action, on the other hand, is probably beyond compare up to this point in cinema.
