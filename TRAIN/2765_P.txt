Do You Think A Pest is Annoying or funny, Falk is both Here
It is interesting to note, Andrew Bergman wrote the script for this one and the recent remake starring Michael Douglas. This is by far the better version. There are several reasons for that.

Arthur Hiller's Direction is definitely better in this one over the newer version. Then there is the more talented cast as Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are definitely more talented than the cast in the remake. It is not that Douglas is not talented, but that he does not fit his character as well as the original actor. Douglas is saddled with an inferior director in the new one too. It is a wonder they didn't get Tim Burton since he is the King of bad remakes, but you can't always get the best of the worst.

The main thing is that this was an original and fresh material version of this film. When the remake was made, it did not get a fresh approach, it stuck with the original. In doing so, it fell flat because imitation is not always the sincerest form of flattery. 

Peter Falk is most known as Columbo, but this is one of several comedy films he made. Falk does Comedy well and this film is no exception. His teaming with Arkin here is inspired & produces very good results.

When watching this film the recent loss of Peter Faulk is felt even more as he is incredible in this as the opposite of Columbo, just winging it without regards to details. The results are so funny.
