Good action in beginning & end but crappy script
"Best war movie of all time", "one of my favorites" and so on...please!The beginning is awesome with amazing action scenes but then what..? It's the usual "USA saves the world" with who-would-have-guessed-it heroes and nauseating flag waving and other clich√©s. I just can't believe that this movie is considered to be the 14th best (or 12th or whatever it is right now...) of all time!?!What's most surprising about Saving Private Ryan is that all the Americans who watched it could get out from the theaters with their big heads. They can't honestly say that this is how they thought WWII was, can they?? All Americans and not a Brit, Frenchman or anyone of another nationality in sight.This movie was made for an American crowd and to make money at the box office. Not to make a believable story about D-day.It's supposed to be really emotional when an American gets killed or injured but the Germans are shot down indiscriminately. This is sickening to me! Is an American life worth more than a German? Spielberg seems to think it is...
