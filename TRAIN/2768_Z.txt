easily one of the greatest films ever!
a tremendous achievement. heartwrenching and powerful beyond words. acting is first rate. Spieldberg's best. whoever dislikes this masterpiece is either dead or knows nothing about what an amazing motion picture is all about. if you are not moved to tears watching this "film of the '90's", then rush out and get a heart transplant!
