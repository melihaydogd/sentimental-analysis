Average, should have been a darker story
This movie is definitely not Bongs best and certainly not the most entertaining.The music score didn't suit the movie, some of the acting too eccentric and doesn't match the movies story, instead of the over the top corporation performance's it should have shown more emotionless and robotic business characters than over the top personalities.The movie should have gone from light humorous to more darker tones which would have been more emotionally involving for an audience/viewer.Good to watch once, but that's about it...
