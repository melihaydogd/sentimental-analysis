Absolute farce with Ben Stiller stealing the show
When Larry Daley ( Ben Stiller ) takes on a job as a night guard at the Museum of Natural History, he begins to understand why there were few applicants for the position.

After sundown every stuffed animal, every skeleton, every prehistoric animal, every diorama wakens into life and all hell lets loose.

Ben Stiller does a sterling performance as the distraught guard. His character performance holds the highly-paced scenes together. He is on the screen the whole time. We get to know him well. We cannot help but feel sorry for the poor fellow who is ready to chuck in the job after the first night.

Where there's a will, there's a way. Larry fights back on his second night mainly in respect for his family especially his son who seems to be the driving force, a little upstart of a kid.

A golden plaque from an Egyptian tomb seems to hold the key to controlling the antagonism between the various exhibits. When this gets stolen by the three day guards (a nasty lot) the museum becomes a battlefield.

Computerized movement seems to be the order of the day with more films resorting to this form of action. Too much of it tends to become boring. If you want something light-hearted, farcical and with no brain power required, this film is for you.

Someone says that the Museum of Natural History is where history comes to life. Believe me, this is an under statement.
