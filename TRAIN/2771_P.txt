The landscape is ethereal and profound, with a chill, and many of the shots are used as screensavers. The more beautiful things are, the more they are marked as objects of contrast by the story. The struggle between human beings and nature is not only reflected in the game between the hero Leo and nature, but also in the collision between advanced civilization and primitive civilization, which is staged in such magnificent and bleak scenery.
