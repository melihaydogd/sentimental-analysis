Utterly annoying
Beautifully edited, filmed and directed, the main character is the most annoying, imbecile, narcissist, disturbed, useless and just plain dumb one ever seen on a screen. The masterful directing and editing (and great styling and styling) is not enough to keep anyone interested. If it wasn't enough, there are a few useless politically correct subplots attached with cello tape, just because, as in everything HBO lately. Nothing wrong with conveying the right message, but when it's pretentious and out of context is just annoying. Anyway, if you like the idea to watch the most annoying character ever doing dumb things around the globe, always- ALWAYS!!!! - drinking vodka or anything alcoholic in every damn scene, then this show is for you.
