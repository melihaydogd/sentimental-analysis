 Top 250?? Criminally over-rated.
LOTR suffers from a technically proficient but creatively challenged story-telling team. The meandering plot, the stilted dialog, the lack of pacing and the amateurish tone all lead me to believe that Peter Jackson should stick to horror films where his abilities are far more suited to that genre's expectations.I look forward to the day when wide-eyed tech lovers awaken from their cgi induced hypnosis long enough to pay attention to the plot and the "technical" merits of a well-told story. Perhaps then talented casts and film crews won't have to be wasted on projects with only a studio marketing team and profit-driven consumer tie-ins to recommend it.
