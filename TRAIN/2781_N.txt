Over rated
I first saw this film when I was 15. I thought it was brilliant, really original and generally great. However, now (3 Years later) I realise it is nothing more than a pretentious piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Sure, it looks good, but when you really get down to it it&#39;s not doing anything. It doesn&#39;t have any real substance, it&#39;s not commenting on anything, it&#39;s just a totally throwaway product. Tarantino is talking loudly and saying nothing. And THAT narrative structure - it looks and feels original, but independent and foreign movies have been doing it, better, for years and years.<br/><br/>A truly trashy piece of postmodernism at it&#39;s worst.
