Interesting movie from many angles
Film looks awful. Storey maybe interesting, but so far away from reality - not sure what it does she wants to say, yeah atrocities are awful during the war and even commenced by US forces while I write this email . It is does not show any historical details as prelude of the war. It does not show any Western Powers influence in the war, it is lacking of any historical details, uniforms, etc. It is shot in Hungary due to Muslim portion of Government ban at the time. Uniforms are wrong, weaponry is wrong; it does not depict any air assaults by Western Powers on Serbian Military (backed by Serbian Military) and ground military assaults by Croatian-Muslim Army (backed up by Western Powers). And finely war resolution in Dayton resulting in one impotent country. It does not show any Western Powers involvement in the war predominantly Germany an USA I am looking forward for her next story and movie in West Bank and Jerusalem (Palestinian side).
