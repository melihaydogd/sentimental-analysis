The Simpletons----- SNORE!
The run of the T.V. series has lasted longer than my marriage.

However watching this movie has left me feeling like the day I walked out of court and my divorce was final. Betrayed and taken for a ride.

It was nothing special. Nothing special at all. I equate this movie to the episode where homer burns down the house Â– only it lasts forever and is not even close to as funny.

The writers of this movie just used the same boring formula that they have for the last few years. The TV show has gone flat and downhill for sometime now. So I guess why shouldn't the movie be any different. Did they put any thought into this? Even this plot has been done on the TV show although not exactly the same way. Anyone recall when they moved the town when homer was sanitation commissioner? The show used to be good when it was well written, it's become a mundane TV show What really sucks is the story isn't even as good as the mundane TV show.

BORING!
