Were they serious?
This movie was a mix of the worst Outer Limits, Twilite Zone, Tales From the Darkside, Creepshow.... ever made. It made Snakes on a Plane look like a serious heart wrenching movie. This movie starts with a pilot communicating with a family of passengers. Suddenly the little boy spots something out the window and freezes. A crash ensues. Fats forward to now. A female pilot is flying herself and four friends to a concert. There is a malfunction with the plane causing her to go into a dark cloud. This results in her losing he bearings as well as causing her flight data to malfunction. She cannot get in contact with anyone via radio. She also realizes that the plane was not fully fueled when they left the airport. This lessens her time to try to get the plane under control and land safely. Watch as her friends try to come up with a solution and the whole movie takes a disappointing turn. Two thumbs way down.
