More left wing science fiction; a left wing 'academic's' 'paper' elevated to truth by the left; typical PR
Everyone with 1/2 a brain knows academic papers presenting alternate views are routinely commissioned by the DOJ to see all possible alternatives.

Ellsberg was just a typical left wing academic that populates most "educational" institutions who simply stated his typical 'useful idiot' 'anti-war' opinion in a 'report'.

He wasn't running the DOJ or State Dept. nor was President. His 'report' was his opinion for whatever it was worth ... really very little or nothing. And is was correctly ignored as a waste of our tax dollars.

This movie is just left wing fiction elevated to the left wing equivalent of religious coda and myth.
