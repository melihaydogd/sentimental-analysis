Why would you end it like that
I really like the Matrix. The first one was amazing. The second one was just as good or even better. Then they throw this crap on screen and call it a movie. This movie was boring. All the neat matrix fight sequences weren't even in it. I know he fought at the end in the matrix but it sucked. You lost interest when they fight in the air like that and it looked stupid. Plus all the Zion fighting was cool at first but after a while you start to ask yourself if it's going to end. Even the basic story was dumb like Neo going blind but still being able to see and then Trinity died just made the story fall apart. They basically wrecked the hype or legend that this movie had that said it was very neat and amazing movie. Now it's nothing. Don't bother with this movie it's a waste of five bucks.
