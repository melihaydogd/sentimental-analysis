How can this get a good rating?
I really don't understand how people could really enjoy this show. It almost seems like this rating is being padded.

First the good: The effects are cool - but nothing really new. The only character that is enjoyable is Rorschach. (His one line in prison was great! - "You guys don't understand. I am not stuck in here with you, you guys are stuck in here with me.") But one line doesn't redeem a movie.

The bad: The story line is confusing and moves all over the place - almost like the editor picked up the pieces off the floor in a semi-random fashion. Flashbacks without any reason. The plot is thin. We never really care about any of the characters. The gore is just for shock value. The guy with the "blue penis" is boring - his character is flat and sterile. There are sex scenes that last way too long - almost a soft porn movie.

Basically - the rating of this is currently 8.1 - Lord of the Rings got a 8.7. If you really think this boring and crappy movie is in the same league as that fantastic movie - then please go see it. Then also take time to view Plan 9 from Outer Space. You will enjoy that too.
