Love it, Michael Douglas amazing!
i love this movie, I saw it without ever knowing what is about, without reading synopsis, nothing, just the poster, and Mr Douglas characterization caught my attention.

The story is very simple (looking for a treasure) but very "loveable" so is Douglas character, which it's an outstanding work of Douglas.

It's a solid and correct script with very nice characters and situations, gags, and arcs.

Also it "look" nice, a lot of nice exteriors, and beautiful music.

On top of that, very interesting the "pararelism" with the story and the story of Father Thomas, nice work there.

Love it.
