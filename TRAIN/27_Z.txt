Not so bad
I read and heard a lot of negative things about this movie before going in. While I am not saying it is a great movie, it is definitely a fun popcorn movie. The characters, dialog, and story are a bit over the top, but this is a comic book movie. If you go in expecting more than a comic book movie, you will likely be disappointed.

So the story is that Elektra turns into an assassin after getting kicked out of good guy martial arts school. She ends up returning to the good side and helping out a young girl and the girl's father. The bad guys are "The Hand". They send assassins and then they send a goon squad with super powers.

My main complaint is getting to be my standard complaint with action movies, that the action is often not visible. Shaky cams, too tight zooms, and quick edits disguise the action. Also, I would have loved a larger role Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who is one of my favorite bad guys of all time.
