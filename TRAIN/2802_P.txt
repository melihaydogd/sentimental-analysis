Definitely a Classic
This one hour feature just has to be seen. Director Sogo Ishii filmed the famous German Band "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" in a deserted factory loft (the perfect industrial setting for their music). It all looks very rough as you would expect it from one of Japans most influential filmmakers (his influence on Shinya Tsukamoto cannot be ignored). This film is rarely to be seen. If you get the possibility to watch it, do not hesitate. The images and the experimental sounds build up a perfect connection, which you do not get that often in concert documentaries.
