Three characters in an inferno of dysfunction
Perhaps an essay on how we are now using technology (the video camera, for example) to interact with our fellow humans? Or maybe an essay on the attraction of pornography? Alienation? Loss of humanity? The film does not address any subject specifically or take a point of view. It presents three characters in search of context: a father, a son, a wanna-be porno actress. The father continues to sink lower while the porno actress starts cementing a connection with the frustrated younger man.

Director Moodyson stages the "action" in hand-held style and gives everything a pornographic intensity. Sometimes the style obscures the message, but the end result is still an experience worth attending.

There is some eroticism on display and we get close-ups of a sex change operation, a character vomiting into another's mouth and a little sex mixed with gluttony. The overall impact is chaos and color, three characters existing in their own infernos of dysfunction.

The film's rawness reminded me of Khan Tusion's ROUGH SEX 2 and some of the German "Sperrgebiet" videos. It's not about redemption and it possesses no answers, but it depicts a reality we fear (and know) is out there.

Sanna Brading as Tess is highly watchable and sexy under the circumstances. Bjorn Almroth is very believable as disaffected youth Eric and Thorsten Flinck is atrociously authentic as miscreant dad Rickard.

Not recommended for everybody.
