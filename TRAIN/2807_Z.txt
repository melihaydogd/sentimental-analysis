The eye candy makes the film worthy of a watch
1939 was in all probability the very best year of any year in the last 100 years of film releases so to be fair, Fast and Furious had a huge hill to climb to receive any recognition when it was originally released in such a stellar year of film making and film releases. Having said that there was a somewhat similar lovable on screen chemistry between actors Franchot Tone and Ann Sothern as there was between the great Katharine Hepburn, and Cary Grant.It is a relatively fast paced, fast talking Ozzie and Harriet style film with actor Franchot Tone getting himself into some deep doo doo with his wife Ann Sothern by financing a beauty contest under the guise of taking a much needed summer break vacation during a heat wave.The story gets a bit tiring around the half way mark with the husband and wife banter but then the eye candy of the bathing beauties provides a deserved distraction not only for financier husband Joel Sloane but for us the audience.it's a cute film that I was happy to watch. The mid range rating of a 5 out of 10 IMDB rating is because it was nothing special either.
