Review.
When i first watched the Trailers this movie looked ambiguous and interesting, and to be honest the Trailers are better than the movie itself. This flick has good performances but that is just not enough, this film does not know what it wants to be, at times the film score has that comedic vibe and then it has that romantic drama vibe, a film score is important to a movie, and this particular score did nothing but add to the already awfulness/wreck of a so-called motion picture. The overall plot is a complete mess and doesn't go anywhere, this film didn't need to be made, as a viewer i could not connect to any of the characters and i didn't care anything about them. The movie desperately tries to give off that lovey-dovey soppy vibe which is unsuccessful and all the scenarios/situations are just plain weird. The Only Boy In New York is another one of those films where the Trailer is the only interesting thing about it. I don't recommend this movie.
