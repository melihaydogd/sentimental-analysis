The Concept is not EVEN Original - but it is bad because....
It is bad because I found it so hard to believe this thing was coming to life. Sorry, folks. As a comedy it's wonderful...even though Scary Movie was better.

But call me jaded. Nothing scares me anymore. After a few films, the genre was done for me way back when.

The concept of having a doll come to life for evil purposes was used a few times by Rod Serling in the old Twilight Zone series. What does this movie contribute to the genre of REALLY being afraid? Folks, have we run completely out of NEW ideas? (The only thing that would frighten me is if cheesy movies like this were the only kinds we could see. Now THAT'S a horror).

I wonder if one day they will ever get accomplished writers to contribute to horror flicks..that is, instead of nerdy, overgrown horror-fan wannabes. Maybe there is hope and a real plot will emerge from the hot air. And maybe, just maybe, we can get these villians to have really interesting MOTIVES that are not hackneyed.

Maybe Speilberg will make one really good one, one day!

Well...I can dream, can't I?
