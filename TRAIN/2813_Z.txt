Its rating gets some other movies lose their meaning
You know that IMDb Top 250 is always discussed, the overrated movies, the underrated movies, the movies which should be in the list, the movies which should not be in the list etc. I believe that movies like Memento causes a problem. The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie. If its rating had been 7.7 or let's say 8.0, it would have been welcome. Probably it is because the script was brilliant, I agree, but as a movie, generally 8.6 is extremely over.
