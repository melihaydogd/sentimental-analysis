How do you review a cultural icon?
This film as well as A New Hope has put me in a very very strange predicament. How exactly does one evaluate a film in which one knows the entire plot a priori, to no fault of the film. As well as a film with astounding visuals at the time, but very poorly aged visuals and shot selection today. Such is my problem with star wars as a franchise. So considering the circumstances, let me shortly say the following.Star Wars is an excellent intellectual property based on an excessively cheesy movie franchise. I feel similarly to the star wars franchise as I do the Marvel cinematic universe. They are a set of fun and entertaining family movies that can make your imagination go absolutely wild. I know I'm not alone in pretending that I was a Jedi or a Superhero when I was young. What the franchise is not is any sort of art film or strong statement about anything. It is pure fun, but perhaps better left in nostalgia than a film to come back to. As the weight of the visual technology fades, it is hard for me to justify that the average storytelling and wonderful soundtrack are enough to carry it.Conclusion: wonderful IP and universe, very cheesy film.
