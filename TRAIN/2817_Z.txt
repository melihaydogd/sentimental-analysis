The great long train chases
"The General" is set during the Civil War and features Buster Keaton as a Confederate chain engineer chasing after Union soldiers that steal his train. Keaton handled the lead role well and the supporting cast was also solid. The film has impressive cinematography and a score that is good at first, but becomes repetitive.The enlistment scene near the beginning was amusing. As was the "under the table" scene and the point were a group of Union soldiers desperately try to fix a part in the train tracks near the end. The film's battle scene was well-shot and amusing and the ending of the film was well-done.Where this film languishes is in the overly long stretch of scenes on the trains, which, while well-shot, become repetitive. I didn't find a lot of humor in the train scenes, which makes the train scenes seem mostly like a precursor to modern action films rather than comedy. Since a lot of the film is consumed by the repetitive train chases, I was left disappointed.
