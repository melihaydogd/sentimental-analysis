Not as good as people say...
It may be a reasonable courtroom drama but the so called shock ending is easy to spot several miles off. Having seen the Usual Suspects which is a far better film which uses a similar idea, Primal Fear was quite slow and tedious. Rent if you're a fan of Richard Gere or John Grisham.
