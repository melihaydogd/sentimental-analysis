This movie is great but needs to be watched more that once spoilers
I love this movie and tend to disagree with most people who describe Charlie as crazy. I think he is actually brilliant. Everything he says in this movie turns out to be true. He is constantly telling Miranda things and says if you don't believe me look it up. Charlie is a genius but most people don't believe him so they label him as crazy. I think the stuff he does in the movie prove his brilliance. Miranda is constantly skeptical about what her dad is saying. Then in the end he says something and then if you don't believe me look it up. But she says she doesn't need to because she realizes hes not crazy after all. I think this movie is also saying something about people who live by the beat of a different drummer like Charlie. They live their lives differently then most people. You don't necessarily have to work a 9-5 job to work. He says he isn't looking for the treasure for the money and she said something like you would if you had to work and his reply is that it depends on what you consider work. There are a lot of subtle things in this movie that you don't get unless you watch it and listen intently. You probably have to watch it more than once. There is a part near the end when Charlie says something about the passageway is suppose to be 40 bars(120ft) down. If there is a passageway it must lead to someplace where he was probably headed when he dove in the second time.
