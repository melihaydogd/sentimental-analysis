Pixar's More Mature Tale: A Charming Travel for Identity
&quot;Ratatouille&quot; is Pixar&#39;s most intelligent, mature and delicate work of all it&#39;s way and experience. I had a laughing time with Nemo, I particularly didn&#39;t enjoy the Incredibles, but with Ratatouille Pixar reached new heights. Animation for adults, hidden in a package for kids.<br/><br/>Â¿Why would you explain love scenes, a cook that was in jail, a cook that ran away from home, a cook that is a gambler? Because adults can enjoy its subtleties and innuendos as kids enjoy the plain and open jokes. Besides the beautiful, vivid voice work, there is an excellent approach to food as art, food as passion. We enjoy movies, some enjoy video games, Remy enjoys food as an art, passion and identity, with different smells, countries and tastes. But the fact that a rat, filthy creature, enjoys this, makes the movie an interesting tale.<br/><br/>This karma of humanizing every little bit of what&#39;s inhuman gives a blatant irony: humans in the film are caricaturesque and are the less developed of all. The positivism of the film, the life they give to the characters is just one part of the story. Graphics excel in the movie: the fact that we want to taste that crumbly, hot bread or eat that elite Roquefort and cherries is impressive, going from the adjusted human expressions to the dynamic of the film, how people move and act.<br/><br/>&quot;Ratatouille&quot; is a nice, charming tale. With superior graphics and voices, and a nice message we can say that if Pixar continues this path, things are going to be very different in the Animation Industry and we adults can take our kids to the movies and be so excited like them as well.
