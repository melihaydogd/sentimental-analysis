Impressed is an understatement.
This for me is the movie of all movies. And Red Billabong coming in a close second. It's the small things like choosing to use the lens flare to give the film character, the costume design so beautifully mastered, incorporating the Aussie slang, carefully picked choice of characters and stunning locations. Well done!
