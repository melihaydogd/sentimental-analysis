Strange Cronenberg Made This, But Still Fun
An oddity within the David Cronenberg filmography. Here he makes a fun, sporty and comedic drag racing movie not filled with goopy monsters or crazy ideas he bleeds out onto the cinematic screen. Fast Company is the name of the company that sponsors changes that drag racing superstar Lonnie "Lucky Man" Johnson (William Smith) makes to his car. John Saxon plays Phil Adamson who does the business side of things with the company. Only he has his own way of thinking how things should be run which goes against Lucky Man's ideas.Interest never drops from the film to me and hey I ain't a drag racing fan, so to me it was good fun. Also has some very good tunes done by Fred Mollin. Written by Cronenberg, Phil Savath, Courtney Smith and an uncredited Nicholas Campbell (who also plays Billy "The Kid" Brooker in the film). Story by Alan Treen. Also starring Playboy bunny Claudia Jennings, Don Francks and George Buza. Sadly this was Jennings last film before she died in a car accident.
