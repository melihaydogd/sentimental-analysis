Inspirational Feel good movie
A feel good movie with beautiful images, which gives a good reflection of modern day Italy and its new immigrants: the Polish builders who might have academic qualifications. Diane Lane, another academic, who has the luck to have the money to be in a better position, acknowledges this fact, and therefore looks after the Polish builders as if they were her family. Stereotypes of Italians and Americans are nicely done away with. The characters want to be judged for what they are as individuals, not for what their nationality is. I was in quite a bad mood when I went to see this movie and left very inspired, thinking about my own life, and how indeed one might see opportunities pass by without taking them, and how it only takes seizing one to start afresh. I enjoy Diane Lane very much as an actress as well. Well worth watching!
