Worst Cronenberg ever.
What a disappointment! I have no doubt: Cosmopolis is the worst film directed by Cronenberg. Maybe, one of worst ever seen.

The script, wrote by Cronenberg, is a complete nonsense. However, he claims to make a sort of critical reflection on capitalism and global society, but it seems that the Canadian director wrote the script using a particular program that randomly selects words and puts them together.

There are no characters in this film. There are actors who play (in some cases read) a poor script.

Pattinson is expressionless, and not as it was Eastwood in Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy or Gosling in Drive, he is just inexpressive.

The problem is that even great actors like Juliette Binoche, Mathieu Amalric and Paul Giamatti seemed horrible.

The real guilty is Cronenberg.
