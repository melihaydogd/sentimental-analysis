FINDING ANSWERS IN THE BOTTOM OF ALCOHOL BOTTLES
My Sister invited me over to watch this movie, since I hadn't seen it, I figured why not, what a mistake that was. I bet the people who paid to see this in theaters around the world wish they had their money back.

Lets hope this is the last Logan anything they ever make. I was gonna give it two stars, but when I saw the dog put his head in a bag and walk out the room backwards, I figured, even he didn't like it.

The movie had no direction, its all over the place, and Logan thinks drinking himself to death will solve all his problems, that has been used to death in movies, it's old and for me I get tired of seeing the main character in a movie try to drink all the booze on the set.

Its a slow dull movie, even the fight scenes are uninspiring,but I'll play the dutiful brother and sit here and watch this piece of trash with my sister and her family, maybe that's why they leave the room from time to time.

Hugh Jackman really need to STOP MAKING MOVIES! Marvel need to fire whoever wrote this screen play or the scripts, when the director come back from his six month lunch, maybe he'll get this movie back on track. It's HORRIBLE. If anyone reads this, save yourself some time, it really sucks.
