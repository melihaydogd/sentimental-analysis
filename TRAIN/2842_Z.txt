Better Than Expected
I had no expectations for this film going into it, in fact I didn't want to watch it but someone else chose it for movie night. I was just happy to watch because I like Anna Faris. However it turned out to be better than expected. I'm sure many people are giving it bad reviews because they're comparing it to the original, but for a romantic comedy, not bad.
