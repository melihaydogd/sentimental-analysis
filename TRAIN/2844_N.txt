Most overrated movie ever made... ohhh boy why this is more than 9.0 in IMDb
To start with, i rarely wright reviews for movies, but after seeing this awful awful movie, i have decided to tell the truth about this piece of garbage.

The movie start very slow with cheesy production and laughable dialogue and once the climax supposedly should come, the movie just skip it as nothing happens!!

It very clear that the director had no clue on what is he doing or what is the direction of the movie.

the setup is bad, i will give you very good example, when Akshay goes to Iraq to meet with the officials, the cast was wearing a UAE national dress were they supposed to wear an Iraqi custom !!! what was the movie maker thinking??!!!

One of my biggest problem also with the movie is the character of the Iraqi military guy, how on earth you put an Indian to portray an Iraqi Officer !!!! they cant find any Arab speaking actor !!! and ohh my god that character is really bad and not believable at all.

This is ultimately & without doubts, one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life from bad acting, dialogue, horrible director, cheap production... everything screams bad from this movie.

THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE EVER EVER EVER
