"Liam Neeson continues to amaze me i feel i am his latest victim top notch performance in" Shindler's List"(1993) totally different from his current action hero image what a versatile actor , this movie send u right back to the Nazi exploitation era it makes u feel that u are present their & makes u to revolt against the exploitation,its been black & white makes it realistic , one cant miss how beautifully everything turns colorful in the end when Jews come to honor Schindler's grave , this movie taken 7 Oscar is not meant for entertaining u with mindless plot & it is a brilliant example of how a true event can be told so if u are interested only to get entertained better watch something else :) "
