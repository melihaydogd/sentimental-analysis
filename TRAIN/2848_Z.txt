Nolan and Bale win!
Christian Bale does a great job bringing this franchise back to life. BB brings the darkness of "Legend of the Dark Knight" combined with strong acting from the entire cast. Nolan doesn't wander to far from the comic batman we all know and love. I for one hope Nolan signs on for the next flick! The story telling is strong though all three acts with no misses that I can see. There is plenty in the story for true Batman fans as well as the casual movie goer. I for one would like to see the entire cast sign on for the next flick as I believe that's what caused the first franchise to dwindle with Clooney (I liked him as Batmaneven with the weird suit).
