Started off good, then went downhill very fast
First 20mins of this I was like... Yes! Ancient weird skeleton shrines and possessed people in the middle of nowhere! Then it turns into a completely different film! I had to check I was still watching the same film! Completely switched off and started pottering about the house it was that boring. I love horror, I love weird in depth horror, but this... Don't bother wasting your time.
