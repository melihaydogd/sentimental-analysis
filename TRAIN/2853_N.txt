I Hate It
Well first off, I hate musicals, and dancing movies, so its a no- brainer that this movie is not for me. I can say nothing good about it, the acting is crap, plot is as cornball as one can get, and it doesn't appeal to me.I also cannot stand any Patrick Swayze movies to date, that weighs in heavily. The only reason I have seen this movie is because when I was young, there was only one T.V., so not much choice with an older sister and mother who love this movie. I wanted to bust the tape, I cannot ever sit through this movie. This definetly not for anyone who does not like musicals or dancing movies, trust me. Avoid at all costs.
