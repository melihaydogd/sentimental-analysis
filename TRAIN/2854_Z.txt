Entertaining, but don't expect reality
Yes, a B movie, but entertaining. Sort of a Red Dawn meets Power Rangers in how unbelievable a lot of it is. I did like the characters and the sub-stories. Some acting was not too bad. What is cool to see is that since there are over 11,000 ratings on here already, at least 11,000 people have seen the movie.... I didn't waste my time on it, it was entertaining enough that I am glad I watched it. But do not expect much.
