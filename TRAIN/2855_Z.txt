After the movie Mirrors, one would think that scary movies about mirrors aren't SCARY!
I refuse to join the consensus to say that this was a good movie. Overall, it was a boring snooze-fest that should have been released straight to video. Thank God that I attended an advance free screening. So the movie is about a woman that goes on a mission to destroy a mirror that has a history of killing others by Supernatural forces. The premise sounds promising but that is where it ends. The movie gets off to a slow start with extensive monotony but ends up becoming more melodramatic with incessant tears. The acting: I must say that the acting was pretty good. My only complaint was the continuous crying that made me question if I am watching a horror or chick flick. The characters were well committed to their roles (especially the mother played by Katee Sackhoff). Other than that, the script was their downfall.I really thought that this was suppose to be a horror film. When one thinks of horror, you expect some scares, jumps, and overall frights. None of this came to pass for me. The movie used the same, played supernatural characters that we've all seen before without any element of surprise. Where's the ingenuity? Maybe I went into the movie with too high of expectations but I should have known that this plot has been used before (Mirrors 2008). Usually I could say more about a movie but there's not much to say but... why? Even one of the movie goers in my theater felt the same sentiment... he started snoring mid-way during the movie (yes others started yelling at him). Again, it seems like I'm the only one that didn't like this movie, but I highly recommend that you wait until it comes on DVD.
