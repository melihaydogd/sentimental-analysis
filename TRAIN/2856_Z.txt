Garbage For The Real Fans, Gold For Everyone Else
Ever since the first movie trailer leaked out on to the airwaves, everyone thought the Simpson's movie was going to be the biggest thing to hit us this summer. Unfortunately, this movie fails on so many levels that it's sad. It's the Hank Scorpio episode remixed and stretched out into a movie. The characters in this movie take such a dramatic turn from their old selves that all we're left with is exploited and annoying failures. Homer was turned from the classic oaf with a big heart for his children into a brainless jerk who relies heavily on slapstick comedy. Bart was turned from bad boy into a emotional drunk and Lisa went from the smart voice of reason into the nagging voice of self righteousness.

It's garbage, and it's 85 minutes of it using the same jokes we saw years ago.

Though, it's not as bad as the last couple of seasons that you may have seen on television, but at least you weren't charged for that. The film, in my honest opinion would have been pretty good if it was a "Made for T.V. Movie" and aired on T.V., but the fact that I had to pay nine dollars for it, makes it pure garbage. Like so many disappointed fans have wrote before me, I want a refund, and if you pay for it, you'll want one to.
