What a let down
Being in my 40's and a big Sci-Fi fan, it was really odd that I had never seen this movie till now - and I have to say, it wasn't worth the wait!

I wont argue that the film was very artfully shot, but the story was slow and just bizarre.

Of course bizarre is what film students and art critics love, so I'm not surprised that this is so highly thought of, and i'm sure they spend many an evening pouring over the plot, trying to find hidden meanings that aren't really there.

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar..... Sometimes a slow and dated plot, is just a slow and dated plot.....

If you watch movies, not to make yourself look intelligent, but rather (heaven forbid), to be entertained, give this one a miss.
