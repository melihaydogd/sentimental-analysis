The definition of a 7 star rating
The premise is very good and interesting, and the story captures you right away, the acting is solid and the movie overall is definitely worth the time.It is also dark and bloody but it makes is point and leave you thinking about capitalism, survival and people being people.However the ending doesn't match the expectations, plot holes are an issue (an issue that can be filled with interpretations) but still I think they could delivered better.
