Predictable and low-budget, but kind of endearing
Let me start off by saying this: if you're expecting believable effects or top-notch acting, maybe set your hopes a little lower.This movie is definitely what you might expect from one of the old SciFi Originals movies. Low-budget with passable but sometimes cheesy dialogue and actors that aren't terrible, but aren't going to be getting any nominations either. The best acting in this movie was done by the little girl character, and even then it's not spectacular.But if you just want to waste some time with a so-bad-it's-funny kind of horror movie, or are just really, really emotionally affected by the thought of endangered animals turning into zombies, you might get a small, cheap kick out of it. I did, even despite how lackluster it was.The CGI isn't great, and there's a scene where one character is held up in the air by a zombie animal and her body position looks laughably fake. But if you can manage to ignore that, it's entertaining enough.Overall, not the worst movie I've ever seen. It had potential, and you can tell there was some heart in it, but not enough to make up for the lack of budget. Still, if you've got an hour and a half to kill and don't mind cheesy low-budget horror, it's not terrible and just barely worth a watch.
