Good, not great and slowish
I love the main actor, actually all the main characters. Something felt like it was missing. The 'baddies' were somehow made redundant. Why were they chasing the her? The first scene baffled me. She exhibited powers to escape from what? Or who? In some way the plot felt the wrong way around. It was enjoyable but not great. Worth a watch.
