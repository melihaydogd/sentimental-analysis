Really Wanted to Like This
I enjoyed Wandavision quite a bit, and I was looking to forward to this show since Sam and Bucky are two of my favorite characters. However, instead of crafting a series with a compelling storyline, Disney went for "White Men are Evil: The Series." If this is where the MCU is headed, count me out. Frankly, it's insulting.
