with this cast hoped for more
So there's Daniel Craig doing a southern accent. why do they think English & Aussie can do American dialects. except for Hugh Laurey doing a generic American accent. Why not hire an A merican, and if needed one who grew up in that dialect. getting past that, the 1st episode was painful. and I forced myself through expecting it can't be this bad. I gave up.
