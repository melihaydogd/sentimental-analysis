Could have been better
Even magic/caper movies need SOME sense of reality. This movie is so full of holes and unbelievable situations it's almost funny. If one can really see it as a fantasy film, then fine. You'll enjoy it. If one wants any coherency SKIP IT. SPOILER ALERT: The twist could have worked if what the Ruffulo character did was believable...but there were SO MANY instances that the writers had him do that did not justify the ending. Too bad, because the photography, music and even some of the acting was just fine. The story should have been completely re-written. Film was also very choppy and it looks like scenes were filmed and cut or should have be written and filmed. Am tired of Jesse Eisenberg playing the same character in EVERY MOVIE IN WHICH HE APPEARS. His acting range is A-B. Give somebody else with real talent a chance at his roles.
