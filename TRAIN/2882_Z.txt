Great cinematography, boring movie
I am one of the few people that did not enjoy "La La Land" at all. I just kept on thinking "when will this movie end?" while it was playing. It was so boring and predictable!

Glad I watched it at a time I could not watch anything else on a plane. Would not have watched it elsewhere.
