unique, weird, but not that funny
It's 1990. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy bum who insists on being called Dude. Two thugs break in to shake him down and pee on his rug. They soon realize they're mistaken. They're looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) whose young wife Bunny ran up a debt. The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while, the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.

This is crazy Coen movie. This is a weird black comedy. It reminds me of the craziest parts of 'Raising Arizona'. It's a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes. This is much more weird than funny. I found only a few big laughs like the fking toe. On the other hand, it is completely unique. A lot of it is weird for weird's sake. It's a lot of weird. I get the sense that this is a great movie to have a good smoke while watching it.
