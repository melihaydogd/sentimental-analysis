Please don't let there be a plan B.
Well, this movie was all I expected it to be - adequate.

If you look at this movie for just another action movie, then you will not be disappointed, because there is a lot of action from the start till the very end, and it works quite well for its. There is fast-paced action here to keep even the most adrenaline-addict satisfied.

Now, regarding to the traditional, classic "A-Team" TV series, well... There were a bit too many changes in this movie for my liking, and having grown up with watching "The A-Team" on TV, I found this movie a stale attempt at bringing life back to the classics.

The cast all performed well, and I do think they had something going on with their choice in actors for the roles. Of course filling out the shoes of George Peppard, Dwight Schultz, Dirk Benedict and Mr. T is quite a mouthful, but still the people in this new movie actually did quite alright.

One thing that had be shaking my head in disbelief was the scene where B.A. was running around, dodging falling containers from the ship. That was too much. That scene was so unbelievable and it sort of took the movie experience down a notch for me.

Also, when the team were departing Germany, they somehow was in a Danish terminal. I know, because I live here in Denmark, so I know what the terminal looks like and I know the uniforms. That was a REALLY bad error in the movie, especially because Denmark and Germany are two different countries! Tch, tch...

Alright, well in overall, the movie works quite well as a "standard" action movie. It worked only adequately as a new interpretation of the "A-Team" story. So I believe this movie will cause a wide array of reviews, given these facts. For me, the verdict is ADEQUATE and scoring a 5/10 rating.
