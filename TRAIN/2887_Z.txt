How Did This Get Nominated for 4 Oscars?
We all know how the Academy continually gives out awards and award nominations to the wrong movies, while snubbing movies that are superior in every other way. HOWEVER, the Academy really dropped the ball here.<br/><br/>I am a huge movie buff and will pretty much watch anything even if the premise doesn&#39;t have mass appeal. This one clearly has less mass appeal, but the critical acclaim drew me in and wasted 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life (I couldn&#39;t watch the last 40 minutes and after reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I was relieved/upset to find out I didn&#39;t miss anything.)<br/><br/>The character development flat out sucks. I&#39;m all for movies with a slightly ambiguous nature, but you gotta satisfy the viewers somehow by letting them know what&#39;s going on and having the movie make sense. Brie Larson is decent in the main role, but her character isn&#39;t really explored and there isn&#39;t enough depth to her character. Jack (don&#39;t know the actor&#39;s name) is a basic 5-year old and I&#39;ve heard a better child-centric voice narration from a Disney movie. <br/><br/>The only reason I gave it a 5 and not something lower is because there are a few aspects of the film I liked. *SPOILER ALERT* The scene where they finally escape from the room is engaging, but after that the film drags on as the people who made this film don&#39;t have any knack for quality storytelling. *END SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>Don&#39;t waste your time on this movie as it doesn&#39;t do justice to a very disturbing subject matter and only leaves you asking one question: Why did I waste 2 hours of my life? Congrats Academy for messing up again. It just really sickens me that great films like Love &amp; Mercy, Straight Outta Compton, Sicario, and The End of the Tour get not nearly the acclaim they deserve by the Academy (Sicario and Straight Outta Compton deserve more nominations) or fail to be recognized by the Academy at all (Love &amp; Mercy, The End of the Tour). The Academy sucks and this film re-confirmed it for me.
