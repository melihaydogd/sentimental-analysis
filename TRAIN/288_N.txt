It's a zu out there.
Tsui Hark's wire-fu fantasy Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain is hailed by many as an unmissable classic of '80s Hong Kong fantasy cinema. I don't understand the acclaim: the story is a mess, but the film is made even more impenetrable thanks to an avalanche of horribly dated special effects that make following the action nigh on impossible. Hark has the gamut of Golden Harvest's early-'80s movie magic techniques at his fingertips and by golly he's going to use them all, narrative cohesion be damned.The film starts off promisingly enough, with 5th century soldier Ti Ming Chi (Yuen Baio) facing death from his own army after confusion about which general to obey; narrowly escaping on horseback, he meets a red army soldier (Sammo Hung) and they become friends. When the pair are suddenly caught in a battle between several factions, they try to do a runner, but Ti Ming Chi is accidentally knocked over the edge of a cliff by his friend, winding up in a strange land inhabited by evil demons.Yuen Baio and Sammo Hung are two of my favourite HK martial arts stars, so I was really looking forward to seeing them fighting together; unfortunately, there is very little in the way of kung fu in this film, and Sammo's soldier disappears after knocking Ti Ming Chi over the precipice (Hung returns later as a different character, an old man called Chang Mei, but the only fighting he does is with his eyebrows!). Ti Ming Chi joins forces with swordsman Ting Yin (Adam Cheng) and two monks to battle the evil.What follows is an over-indulgent mess of whizz-bang non-stop action, with lots of flying about, leaping, somersaults, and explosions, utilising utterly ridiculous wire-work and really bad visual effects (the animation is particularly awful). The incomprehensible nonsense includes big scary Jawas, a laughing fish, animated blood crows, a female demon whose head comes off, flying stone elephants, a character puffing up like a bag of microwave popcorn before exploding, and an old man chained to a massive metal ball. Sounds like crazy fun, but without any semblance of a fathomable plot, it soon becomes tiresome.Having no idea of what was going on, and not particularly impressed by the laughable effects-laden action, I fell asleep before the end (I did finish the film when I woke up, but forcing myself to do so wasn't easy).1.5/10, rounded up to 2 for Brigitte Lin and Moon Lee: their presence -- as members of a clan of female warriors -- made the movie just a little more bearable.
