Great for Film Historians - but very boring.
I saw a restored version at a theater when it was released recently. I also have seen the longer Madacy DVD version. Both times I viewed this film, I was dreadfully bored. It has some glimmers of greatness. Mostly, it is just dull. I would like to see the Kino version of Metropolis. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but film historians.
