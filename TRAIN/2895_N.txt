Worth my price of admission
After seeing another, excellent, movie, I decided to do a little illicit theatre hopping and moved over to see G-Force.

It was worth just what I paid to get in.

I would list the plot holes, inanities, and just plain stupid parts, but this review is limited to 1000 words...

However, some of the more memorable (sadly): Yes, the funniest scenes are in the trailer. Why do the G-Force team members still talk after their translators have been taken? What, another sighting of the evil FBI guy? Flatulence. Enough already. Super-secret lab in a warehouse -- where have I seen that before?

Unfortunately, I can't give anything lower than 1 star to this waste of time.
