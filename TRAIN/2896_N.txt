Long Dull and confusing
L.A. Confidential is one long dull confusing movie with small sparks that quickly fade and burn out, even a stellar cast including Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe cant get past the convoluted script that makes so many twists and turns you will get a headache, the acting is good except for one person and that one person is Kim Basinger who for some unknown reason was given an oscar, I say given because her performance in this movie was not only terrible but it was one of the worst I have ever seen. If you like good movies try something else, if you like watching a movie for three hours that bores you to tears and makes you say thanks god that is over try this. 3 out of 10 stars
