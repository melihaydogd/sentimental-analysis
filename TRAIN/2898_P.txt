Infinitely deep, an experience I will not forget.
*Insert all 9 &amp; 10 reviews here* I was in awe during the entire film. Lenny Abrahamson &amp; the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of &quot;insignificant&quot; characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I&#39;ve seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.
