Wonderful animation, mediocre storyline
After Pixar's previous efforts The Incredibles may suffer by comparison. Yes the animation is wonderful and detailed but the storylne and script leave a lot to be desired. One big disappointment was that there are very few genuinely funny moments and it felt more like an animated action movie. The storyline concerns itself with individuals being proud of their talents and that everyone should try to become the best at what they excel in. This is wrapped together with what is at best a hackneyed spy or action movie storyline that is not going to win any prizes for originality.

This is not a bad film but by Pixar's standards is definitely not a great one.
