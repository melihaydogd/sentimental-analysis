Started out strong but losing it quickly
I enjoy shows I can watch with my daughters whom now are 18. I love discussing things with them and having good conversations. That is how it has been with this show. None of us are lesbian (at least that I know of lol) but can all enjoy peoples differences. We have been pretty open in watching but now I have an issue. In these last couple of epsiodes it tells the story about the twins dad being a sexual offender. It makes light of megans law because although he was over 18, they will still close in age and had sex. This does NOT represent the MAJORITY of sex offenders. If one kid thinks it is OK to date someone on the sex offender list bc they are told of this scenario - it is wrong! Are you kidding me Jennifer Lopez? Think of your daughter! Young girls (and boys) brains are not yet fully developed. They want to believe everyone is good. This scenario is NOT OK. Glorifying a sex offender because he was "in love" with someone underage is not romantic but that is how it is coming off. Sicking. It is against the law for a reason. There are other ways to approach this but again glorifying a sex offender is really disheartening to those whom have been abused in real life situations. My heart goes out to those whom are under aged and have or are being abused in real life. They have a voice too you know.
