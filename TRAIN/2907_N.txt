It's just bad, and not in a good way
I went expecting it to be bad. But sometimes bad can be entertaining. This was just bad. There was no entertainment value in its badness. It's like the cinematic equivalent of the Tide pod challenge. Many in the theater could not take it and left. Those of us who stayed only succeeded in poisoning themselves. Not much of an accomplishment. I found myself angry-angry at the people who made it, angry at the people who distributed it. It is an indictment of capitalism that someone can sell something this bad and not face imprisonment.
