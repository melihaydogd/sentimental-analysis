What did we ever do to Disney?!?!?!?!
If I could rate this movie 0 stars I would! I brought my 3,6, and 12 year old brothers and 10 and 14 year old sisters to this movie. They were all excited to watch it but we were all very disappointed. It was horrible. I hated every moment of that torture. My siblings wanted to leave and I was already picking up everything to leave before they said that. Of course I did not want to waste the money so we stayed and waited for the other movie because we were in an drive in. These kids always stay completely still during movies but when I saw them start fidgeting and ask to use the bathroom I saw them start playing with their ds and going in the car to watch another movie in our cars TV. Don't you dare waste your money on that!
