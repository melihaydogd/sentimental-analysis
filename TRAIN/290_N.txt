What a long and incredible boring movie
I will admit i saw this film by mistake, but how can anyone like this movie it's long and boooooring. The story in this movie is truly about a very serious subject , but after 15-20 minutes i didn't give a damn, i almost fell a sleep, half the theater i saw it in walked out before the first Â½-hour, i almost left too but i stayed, because i thought no movie can be that bad, but i was wrong this one was!!!!
