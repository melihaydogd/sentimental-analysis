Jingoist Hollywood Propaganda Trash. Vomit inducingly so.
This film is dire. First 20-30 minutes are acceptable, just about. I hoped the movie may improve. Alas, I was wrong. The last 30 minutes are top drawer trash. The middle is, well trash as wellÂ… Patriotism and propaganda it seems is ABSOLUTELY all Hollywood is about these days. I know Hollywood have always done their fair share for "war" efforts. However, with the Soviets no longer a threat and they've all but finished bashing the poor folks from the Arabian peninsula, now it's on to North Korea. One man, Yes ONE man, (American man of course) saves not just the day, but the president, not once but TWICE, saves his son to boot, plus he saves the White House (albeit in part). During the mayhem and chaos and one man army Heroics our man still finds time to make flippant calls on his "cell" to his beautiful wife; herself an all American Heroin working in the ER (blood smears and wide eyes cuteness to spare). The musical score is so trite and jingoistic it is vomit inducing - make sure you have a sick bag handy. Everyone involved in this excuse for a movie should take a long hard luck at the drivel they have churned out.
