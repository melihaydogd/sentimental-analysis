Less a horror and more a supernatural drama about love throughout the ages
After the huge success of 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' the previous year, Universal Studios expanded their repertoire of movie monsters by capitalizing on the aura of Egyptian mystery still fresh in the popular consciousness from the discovery of Tutankhamen (along with all the attendant curses) only ten years before. What's more, fresh from his iconic role as the Monster in 'Frankenstein' Boris Karloff is perfectly cast as the resurrected mummy of the title, Imhotep, who (like the Monster) looms large and stares menacingly as the ostensible villain but also conveys an essential humanity which, by the end, invokes more sympathy than fear and strikes a surprisingly poignant note by the time the credits roll.

The story begins in 1921 when an ancient scroll, "The Scroll of Thoth", is unearthed and read by an over-enthusiastic archaeologist which inadvertently resurrects the mummy Imhotep who promptly disappears, sending the archaeologist mad. He reappears a decade later going under the name Ardath Bay, a looming, enigmatic figure who walks among the living and aides in another archaeological so that he may pursue the reincarnated soul of the woman he loved over 3000 years before and employing magic to destroy anyone who hinders his obsessive aim.

As is common with films from this era, the film is slow-paced and is low on explicit scares by modern standards, but first-time director Karl Freund (previously a cinematographer on a number of German Expressionist films such as Fritz Lang's 1927 classic 'Metropolis' as well as Universal's own 'Dracula') effortlessly crafts a suspenseful atmosphere which remains gripping throughout as Imhotep's motivations and fatal flaws are revealed. The cast are uniformly excellent: obviously Karloff (with the help of a make-up job from Jack Pierce, who also transformed Karloff into Frankenstein's Monster) owns the feature despite relatively little screen-time but the rest of the cast flesh out the drama brilliantly.

All in all, 'The Mummy' is a remarkable film which will probably confound many expectations of what it will be like from the slew of pop-culture references most people will have accumulated regarding the theme. I know I was. However, even though it may be a different film to what most would expect, there is no denying the great movie that it is.
