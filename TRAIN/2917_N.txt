a pain to watch... (to be fair i watched it with a frined and she liked it...) so idk
If you'd ask me even if designed for children and.... the movies is simply bad.... simply boring and too emotional... i mean we get it it's a movie about emotions but everything feels over done predictable boring empty...

the ending was good and a bit funny in a sence but not enought to save from a 1 star

everything about the plot felt like it was over tought and very poorly... from the chalanges and path and.... it simply feels like it could have bring so much better...

and while i generally don't like movies of this kind and it is for children nd i took that into account most movies of this type are for me... "sufferable" but this one was such a cliche was so boring such a pain to watch that i simply regred watching it at all... boring if you'd ask me... your kids might like it maybe not but in the end of the day there are much better alternatives and...

to be fair the movie does look good visually... with good animations and..... but that's more of a technological thing...

whn i was a child movies weren't really like that... and that's a good aspect... yet movies for children from my time were better..... with better stories and u know...............................
