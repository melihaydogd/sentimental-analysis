EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS
A fresh take on Spiderman that leaves you wanting more. The fight scenes were incredible and the animation style was used to the movie's advantage. Visually very stunning and although there are things in the movie that were rather underdeveloped, e.g. Prowler, overall it didn't detract from all the good that the movie brings.
