PinkFloydTheMusicOrTheMovie
Really they could have shown any pictures, movies, cartoons, or anything else, with this excellent sound track and fab songs, it would be worth watching and listening to. Its all quite grim and bleak but then thats what a lot of Pink Floyd songs are like. I think the songs (and movies) of earlier decades are much better than the rubbish in the charts at the moment. And Pink Floyd are a perfect example of this fact. My favourite song from the wall is Comfortably Numb, this is also my favourite's Pink Floyd song from any album. The first time I watched the cartoons that came with Pink Floyd songs, I was only about 6 or 7 years old, and they hypnotised me then, and they still hypnotise me now, although for different reasons. By the way the other group that I really like and am a huge fan of is Queen.
