Best new cartoon show 2013!
The show feels fidgety in the beginning. At first it makes you take a second to get used and into it. But it&#39;s as intelligent and hilarious a show as I haven&#39;t seen one since a long time! That&#39;s what I and hopeful many other viewers are going to realize after a couple of minutes. It&#39;S one of those shows that wouldn&#39;t happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that&#39;s one thing that makes it so hilarious. It&#39;s really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people. I really hope this goes on for a while, though! I love this show - it&#39;s great. Keep up the good work<br/><br/>PS.: I hope they take one or two scientists on board to help them with Grandpa Rick to keep him on track regarding scientific accuracy. But that&#39;S just a personnel tic of mine...
