Only for (little) children.
As many of you might know (specially after the Lord Of The Rings mania) "The Hobbit" relates some facts previous to those that are shown in Tolkien's masterpiece: Bilbo Baggins and his adventures in the Middle Earth, how he found the ring, etc. This adaptation is sort of a small version of the book, and it's clearly oriented for the kids, for those little children that can't read Tolkien's books yet.

There isn't much more to say about it, though I don't think this movie will make the kids get interested in reading. It doesn't does justice to the original story at all, and I DO hope that someone shot the author of the songs in the soundtrack (Jesus, what a torture!!).
