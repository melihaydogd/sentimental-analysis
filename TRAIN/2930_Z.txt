I am not able to fully appreciate it
It is a silent film made in the 20s, a world vastly different from mine, and i can not see how i could possible understand the political goings on in Germany at that time or even the social goings on. How can i say this film is bad or good all I do know is that I as a 18 year old British kid did not enjoy the film and was thankful when it was over. For such an old film i just couldn't appreciate it. I do however think that the cinematography is obviously fantastic and very creative for the time the film was made. A second point i would make is, I do not believe silent films can be rated in the same way that the films now can be. They are so different and comparing them is ridiculous. So watch this film for the historical context at least and if you do enjoy it then that's a bonus.
