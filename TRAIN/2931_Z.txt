White people are the enemy!
I will see the show to the end just for continuity sake...also, holy cow, can they smack us around with the anti-American sentiment any more? I'm starting to feel like the writers have the true enemy as...not Zemo, not discount Captain America, not the Flagsmashers...but ALL white people are the enemy! I'm ok with an underlying theme of that kind of stuff, but the last few episodes just kept punching me right I the face with it. I don't care if you are left or right, I just want to keep politics OUT of entertainment.The acting is ok, I feel like they really nerfed Bucky (anyone remember how bad a** he was in The Winter Soldier??), and Discount Captain America...I like what they are doing with him, he plays a rage monster pretty well.Five episodes in, I was hoping I wouldn't be exposed to Bucky and Sam fixing a boat for 30 minutes.Pretty average series, especially when it stands next to WandaVision...
