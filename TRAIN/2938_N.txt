Austen would approved the Zombies over this movie
This movie is guilty of murdering Jane Austen's wit and charm, not to mention historic accuracy and cleanliness. It is more reminiscent of the misery and filth depicted in Dickens or Hardy (Victorian era) rather that Austen (Regency Period). I could almost smell the pig stench off of their greasy hair and dirty clothes. This has nothing do with Austen's world of pomp and circumstance. It is so very obvious that no one involved with this movie has even read Austen. I adore Dame Judy, but she should have walked off this set. The characters mumble and spit out their dialogue like modern-day teens at the burger king takeout window. The witty and clever vixen, Miss Eliza Bennet, has been turned into an unkempt, angry and out of control mess; the house is dilapidated and run down, more in keeping with Fanny Price's ramshackle hovel from Mansfield Park, not Longbourn. But perhaps the biggest travesty of all is the way this movie has crushed and humiliated one of the cleverest and most sardonic of characters in literature by portraying Mr. Bennet as a sniveling, downtrodden, Hen-pecked half- wit. Even the one scene that could have had any redeeming qualities, namely, Mr. Darcy cutting a handsome figure walking half-dressed through the misty field in slow motion, was a blatant and shameless rip-off from no other than Colin Firth's epic wet shirt moment in the fabulous and exquisite 1995 version (a must see). So, the only reason this movie should even exist is to expose a whole generation who would never read any of Austen's books to an imbecile's attempt at a cliffs note version of a magnificent masterpiece.
