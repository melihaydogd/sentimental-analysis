Meh..
I really like Anna Faris but this movie really just made me want to watch the original...I guess Im a fan of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell..they made it a great movie! Unfortunately this one is just lacking...but in saying that if you haven't seen the original than this movie would probably be fun for you!!
