Elektra - great movie
This was an awesome movie just as good as dare devil

i think they should make a sequel definitely .

maybe let the two meet up again . great movie with great actors good job guys. i think that the movie was exiting all the way through i think that the movie was extremely well plotted i think that Jenifer garner is the best actress ever the movie very different from any other I've seen which is a good thing i will be sure to keep my eye out for the sequel go cast and crew you guys are awesome you rock !! my fave part in the movie is towards the end where elektra throws the sai through the hedges and fully kills the death chick it was awesome .
