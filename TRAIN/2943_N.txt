Good quirky lines
This movie is geared towards those who are 18 and older. Peter Falk and Alan Arkin work well together in this action filled comedy. It is funny but not rip roaring funny. Good quirky lines with the action to back them up. It is a good movie in the evening to watch. The plot is halfway decent for a comedy. It does, however, have a fairly predictable ending for this movie. You kind of figured out the ending once you found out about what got stolen. Although Peter Falk played a somewhat comical figure as Columbo, the inept-yet result getting detective; this movie show Peter Falk in a true comedic role. Cook up some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the movie. It will though be forgotten by the time the next night rolls around and you are looking for a movie to watch. Enjoy
