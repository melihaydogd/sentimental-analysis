Solid Acting
Tye Sheridan was awesome in this. Very talented young man.

The story was interesting and the acting was solid. The big bummer here is a lack in detail and depth. Everything is very in the moment and portrayed as what you see is about all you're going to get. It is the biggest flaw in my opinion.

Not bad just not enough depth. Good watch.
