Miyazaki masterpiece
I will admit hesitation in viewing the latest Miyazaki film, simply because of my own close-minded first impression of it.  Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).  Therefore, after seeing that this film was more fantasy than reality, I was not in a hurry to see it. Unfortunately, this meant that I missed out on having seen a masterpiece for several months.  Spirited Away, the story of a little girl who must somehow escape from a world inhabited by fantastical characters is as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it is about the incredible creatures that surround her in her new environment.  While Spirited Away is a fairy tale, it is also a lesson in accountability, strength and responsibility. 	 Miyazaki is known for creating strong young female characters that are also completely adorable, but Spirited Away contains some of the most interesting co-stars I have seen in recent memory.  A lamp that not only provides a guiding light, but also happens to hop along on one foot, a giant baby and a bird with the head of an elderly lady are just three of the many eccentric characters we experience.  Not only are the characters and story line rich, but the artistry is absolutely beautiful as well.  The colors and character design are flawless and awe-inspiring.  Even I, the cynical and technical viewer found myself saying `Aww' and smiling at the little soot monsters and the `mouse'.  The hype was worth it and the Oscar was well-deserved.  Spirited Away is a beautiful film that really and truly should be experienced, and has the potential of being enjoyed by most, because it has so many layers and imaginative aspects that there will be points of appeal for just about anyone.--Shelly
