Not the worst movie ever, but....
Just finished watching this from a download. I live in China (UK born though) and DVDs here only cost $1, or 50p for the Brits out there. I could have picked this one up but downloaded it because I had travel plans and wanted something on my MP4 player.

It was $1 well saved.

I read some of the reviews here, one of which was written by someone who thought this was an ironic side swipe at the slasher/gore genre.

Sorry, but it wasn't. It's pretty clear that this movie was made in all seriousness and is intended to be a gory thriller with a twist ending. I will happily concede that the twist was interesting enough and not one I suspected.

But the rest of the movie is just not good. Lohan does a better job as Dakota than she does as Aubrey, but she doesn't have much to work with in terms of character or script. As most others here have said, the killer's identity is clear almost from the get go. The blue motif is insanely heavy handed. Julia Ormond and Where Have I Seen Him Before are both accomplished actors with good reputations and I really don't know what they are doing here. Maybe the producers spent the writers budget getting these actors on board.

But in all fairness, this really isn't the worst movie ever made. It is pretty bad, and a little disgusting in parts, poorly scripted, lacking direction and only adequately acted. I think it might appeal to someone around 14 or 15 who wants to be grossed out and maybe a little scared, but to be honest, I think that 14 and 15 year olds are more discerning.

Anyway, my advice would be to leave this one alone. It fails to deliver on so many levels.
