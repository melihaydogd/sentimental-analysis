Worst. Movie. Ever.
I wish I could actually give it negative stars. This is complete and utter nonsense. A non-existent script that the actors blindly ad-lib through, clearly making it all up as they go along. They fumble and flail worse than any of the found footage junk I've waded through. The worse thing is they don't seem like it's their first time in front of a camera, but they obviously just showed of to set and were told to just wing it. There are Plot holes big enough to swallow actual Black Holes with room to spare. A story that is so cliche it's an insult to the word 'cliche'. The action is Clogged with 'gotcha' moments that don't 'getcha', and is repetitive to a fault. Even the music is off-putting. I found myself wishing somebody in a mask would break in and chop my own head off. I kept waiting thinking , it has to get better, but it actually just keeps sinking deeper into farce. Ed Wood seems like Spielberg or Scorsese compared to this director. I weep for the millions of dollars wasted here that could have funded so many other independent movies instead of this tripe.
