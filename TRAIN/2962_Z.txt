Insufferable, but hilarious.
There are some terrible acting moments from Cage and Connery here that are as entertaining as a strong Brando moment, so the terrible script can be ignored for the entertainment value.

The direction sucks, the acting is worse, but it's worth a watch for those who love schlock. A fun drinking game is to take a shot every time there's a cringe. You'll be drunk in 20 minutes.
