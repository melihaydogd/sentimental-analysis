Very thought provoking
I find it sad that so many people have given this movie such negative reviews, I think this movie is very underrated maybe its just because Angelina Jolie directed it and not some hot shot like Steven Spielberg or something maybe people have a vendetta towards Angelina or something,or maybe people are peeved because it doesn't tell the story of the Bosnian war in a realistic way, but I think the movie was very well done, the actors were superb,and the story although not completely true, was very thought provoking , it gives you a sense of what it was like, I found it very sad and tragic I think that's all Angelina was trying to do was to give you a sense of what it was like, she never said it was going to be a documentary or anything, I think for her first time directing she didn't do a bad job, this movie isn't perfect but its not bad either, I think people just need to get over there issues,the whole brad and Jen thing was so last decade ago get over it already.
