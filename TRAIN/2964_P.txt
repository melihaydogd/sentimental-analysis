I really loved this movie and don't understand the crappy rating.I
I watched this on Amazon Prime, expecting nothing. I put it on the background while I was doing work, but then ended up watching it instead of doing my work. I thought the actors were natural and the story was sweet. It's really about friendship. And about kids trying to find their power to do things. I think it had several important messages. Perhaps kids wouldn't understand this movie fully until they grow up. I'm 44 and I thought it was a perfect movie for a Sunday afternoon and the alien was supercute.
