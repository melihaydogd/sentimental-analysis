 Not sure why so many loved this movie.
This movie was over-hyped, and the only thing about it that I found fabulous were the special effects. However, this did not make up for the lack of emotional depth in the movie and the drawn out attempt at building suspense. Compared to the series of books this movie is based on, the movie seems shallow and lacks cohesiveness and character development. I was bored and just wanted the movie to finish, which is rare for me. Less focus on special effects and more attention to good acting and a story that builds suspense would have made for a better movie. Perhaps a little more background into the character's lives, for example, would have added a lot to the overall presentation.
