Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed, disturbingly violent, and incredibly powerful films.
The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying &quot;Wheres all the violence&quot;, Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.<br/><br/>This is one of the movies I don&#39;t get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: &quot;Are you gonna bark all day...&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll make you my dog&#39;s bitch&quot;. Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don&#39;t know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there&#39;s a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino&#39;s best movie. I didn&#39;t care much for the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; movies, but who cares, I&#39;m not reviewing them.<br/><br/>If you haven&#39;t seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now.
