Superior over original in almost everyway.
99% of time remakes are worse or much worse. This time I prefer the american remake. The original was a weird and bizzare movie, this fixed most mistakes. Firstly, it's much better edited and presented. Secondly the dialogues are much better. Thirdly the acting is so much better and all the people now feel like people instead of weirdos in the original. Fourthly, it takes so much more time in the room, which makes it much more intense and interesting, the original only had a few scenes in the room, but in this one we spend much more time and we understand the protagonist a lot better. Lastly the action scenes and thriller apects are much improved it feels high quality. The only thing which sucks is the ending... The original had a good ending, but this one tried something different and it was terrible.
