Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel

Usually, when you place three wild rodents in a recording studio surrounded by expensive equipment and press record, all you get is the sound of them chewing through the microphone cord, followed by a crackle of electricity, and three death rattles.

However, in this furry family film, when you put a trio of tree dwellers in a studio, you get a bunch of high-pitched cover songs.

With Dave (Jason Lee) in hospital after a chipmunk related accident, the boys, Alvin, Simone and Theodore (Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney), are entrusted to his nephew, Toby (Zachary Levi). Required to attend high school, the Chipmunks make a big splash on campus when they're asked to save the school's music program. But before the boys can collect the prize money, they must best an all-female chipmunk group (Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate).

A perfunctory sequel to the 2007 original, The Squeakquel maintains the same low expectations as its predecessor: the story is sorry, the songs are boring, and the star- studded vocal cast is superfluous.

Besides, the only time you're libel to find chipmunks inside of a high school is when the cafeteria is serving mystery meat for lunch. (Red Light)
