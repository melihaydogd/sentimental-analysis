Movie is good. But overrated
Seriously guys. Its a great action movie, but this should not be in the top 250 list.

The action was great.

The story-line, though, was not consistent with the comic books, was decent.

The special effects were great, as expected.

The characters were believable.

On and on, it was an acceptably average movie. Worth spending money.

Watching it in theatres in 3D was a real treat! BUT, No way in hell was it memorable or noteworthy or groundbreaking. It certainly does not deserve to be in top 250 list and be rated above 8 because its just an average movie.

I am beginning to loose faith in IMDb rating system now.
