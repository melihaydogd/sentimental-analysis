Der Untergang
This movie shouldn't have been made, because it is absolutely impossible to express this part of the history in posterior made pictures. Let us remember that the plot of this film is based on the personal experiences of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, the script written by Joachim Fest, a historian known as viewing history from a very conservative angle. To persons like him history consists in the results of the thoughts and deeds of persons at power, instead of understanding history as the sum of what all humans are thinking and doing, not to forget the effects of what is happening in the nature around us and, not less important, of what happens by accident.

The realism of this film is its weakest point, because it creates at the spectator the illusion of being well informed about what really happened. To learn more about the psychotic nature of this depraved crew of gangsters I would recommend to view Leni Riefenstahl's documentary "Triumph des Willens" about the "Reichsparteitag" in Nuremberg, Germany, from 1935, made on Hitler's orders. There you can see the real physiognomies and discover the collective paranoia in which fell most of the people of a country which was until then considered as a "Kulturnation".
