The worst major movie ever made
I saw this in a first-run theatre in Philadelphia the week it came out. This is he only movie I ever voluntarily walked out on it is that bad! I had great hopes because of the advanced publicity and the talented people who worked on it but nothing works. It is so annoying, that at times I wished the theatre would catch fire so I would have an excuse for leaving.

What else can I say. Others enjoyed it but this is one picture that stank so much, I still remember how bad it was after all this time (this is being written in 2005).

I've seen movies with Liz Taylor that I liked but she is badly miscast in this picture and her acting is probably her worst job ever.
