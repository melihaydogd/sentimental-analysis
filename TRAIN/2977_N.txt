Movie fan, really Not impressed
I never write reviews, I never think films are as bad as they are made out to be by everyone and I am a big movie fan However... This movie was really bad! Not even mentioning the gender message they were trying to sell, the film itself is boring and not even entertaining. As a comic film it was even worse. Even Harley Quinn wasn't as effective as she was in Suicide Squad. I thought Suicide squad as a film and DC comic adaptation was bad....but birds of prey makes Suicide Squad now seem like a good film. Bad to worse for the DC Universe. As for the portrayal of the main villain in this film...what a joke!
