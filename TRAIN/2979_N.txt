Hype
This film has always been in the back of my mind as one of the greats. One of those must see films that I just hadn't got around to watching yet. So I made a point of watching it.

Oh dear.

Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this film, I gave it the benefit of the doubt considering it's age and the hype surrounding it but it was dreadful.

In my opinion, if Lee hadn't died tragically during the making if this film then it would probably have gone straight to DVD and I wouldn't have just sat through an hour and half of dross.
