I Forgive You Clint
The Best Western ever they said. Clint Eastwoods masterpiece and the last real western ever made they said. Did they..did they really. I think THEY were talking through they're cowboy hats. Good movie sure..top notch performances and very well directed but not anything we haven't seen a thousand times before. The outlaw Josey Wales was a much better western and mirrored the same sentiment of a mans past catching up with him. Violent yes but we are lead to believe that they were violent times..cannot comment on that because I wasn't there.Gene Hackman is great as the violent sheriff trying to keep order in violent times and of course Clint makes a great cowboy but this movie lacks a little something for me. I also think that the men portrayed in this would worry too much about a prostitute who had a few scars on her face either..but that's irrelevant. At times the music goes off and you expect Clint Eastwood to start singing . All in all a few hours of a good western but I don't for one second believe it was Oscar material..I think they thought Mr Eastwood deserved one before he died.
