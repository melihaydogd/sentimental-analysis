For a B movie just above SCIFY channel quality this is actually not that bad. Inventive rework of Moby Dick. I say B
"Only one man will live to tell the tale of Ahab, one man only." Ishmael (Sevier) is a hunter. He has hunted every animal in the world except one. He decides to join the crew of Ahab (Glover) in an effort to hunt down and kill a dragon. The crew signed on for just a simple hunt that will net them a lot of money but Ahab has a different reason. I have to admit something first. I am 33 and have never read (or even seen a movie) Moby Dick. I know the basic story but none of the specifics. Going in to this one I was expecting much lameness mainly because of the fact that this is retelling of Moby Dick with dragons instead of whales. I thought how could this be good, and it seemed like a SYFY channel movie. Based on those expectations I have to admit that I was actually pretty surprised at how entertained I was by this. This is a definite B movie with a decent cast but it really sucked me in and I was enjoying myself the entire time. Fans of the real Moby Dick may be turned off by this, but I actually enjoyed this. Overall, a low budget SYFY channel-esqe movie but surprisingly entertaining. I can't believe it but...I give it a B.
