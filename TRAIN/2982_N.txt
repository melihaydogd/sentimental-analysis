Utterly shambolic
Having attempted to watch this once before and failed, I tried again due to its nod at the Oscars thinking maybe I hadn't given it a fair chance.

It really was a disappointment end to end, bar some of the visuals it was certainly one of the worst Marvel films I've seen, and I think it's fair to say none of which were Oscar worthy in the best picture category (other categories maybe). It's a big shame that other genuine brilliant movies would have missed out on their chance of an award due to this.

If it's taught me anything, it's that the Oscars are no longer relevant and should be ignored. Perhaps also many of the major film review sites as the ratings must be artificial, hopefully that gets exposed at some point as it would be questionable ethically if not also false advertising...
