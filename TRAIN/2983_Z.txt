Slightly better than a puppy video on YouTube
Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, just painfully average. I watched the entire 2 hour film in about 30 minutes on Netflix, well I have the bad habit of fast forwarding boring movies and TV shows. what can i say, predictable plot (wait, was there a plot?), forgettable cast(on man they even got the guy from the walking dead to play that.. hmm what's his name?). Acting talents wasted.It's a film you can guess the ending right at the beginning, not sure this would be counted as a SPOILER, but here you go, the whole film can be summed up in one sentence, yes you have guessed it.Korean girl saves her pet from evil cooperation.This film is a beautifully crafted love letter to those animal lovers and they will no doubtfully praise the film to the highest heavens(admit it, some people rate this film 10 out of 10 just because the animal liberation activists are artificially glorified in the film). But really, the film barely, barely scratched the surface of the meat industry, well I guess a script dares to go deeper down the rabbit hole wouldn't be approved by the sponsors.But congratulations on selling more Okja toys in Mcdonalds and KFCs, well done!
