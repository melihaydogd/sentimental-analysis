yep
as far as being friends (in the past) with every person in this movie... It was a good movie but with a select few that acted in the movie it became a life changing joke. The movie is well edited, and well put together, but they should have done more research/ interaction/ spending time with some of the participants. Especially the one who was born on Christmas day and has the initials j.c. because this Movie/ Film drove him to rock and screw his friends lives up forever. It All went down hill after this...... That will be the real cool movie to see. Because I have most of the footage of the downfall of Cook. A genius that was driven to insanity by the patronization of those who used the crud out of him and promised him a piece of it all............ He is a "Nut" now because his so called friends promised him the world...

F! you guys
