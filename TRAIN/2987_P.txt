Most underrated film!
Snyder is a but of a mixed bag and people seem to either hate or love the guy. Regardless of how you feel about his films now, you can't say Watchmen isn't a great film. Its a visual masterpiece and just so much fun. I've watched this film no short of 100x and I can't wait to watch it another hundred. Forget the Snyder hate and just watch it!
