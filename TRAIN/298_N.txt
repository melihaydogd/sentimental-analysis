Where Has All the Magic Gone?

I am scared about future of movie industry and I am scared of going to the cinema. Movies have become so awful, boring and unwatchable. This one is no exception, it's a one of many many disastrous movies in a last few years. There is no meaning, no message,this movie is an empty vessel without the purpose whatsoever. So, I am giving two stars for fine actors, and I am being generous.
