Idiotic Slickness->Better Title: The GPS Made Me Do It.
This movie starts off reasonably slick and cool, but after the action starts we realize this dumb monotone woman's voice is simply directing our characters around an unrealistic set of pre-planned events and you realize- you are simply watching someone idea of one of those speaking car/speaking devices going crazy and instead of telling you to turn left, go ten miles it says jump now you have 30 seconds and a door opens and someone starts shooting at you. After the 3rd incidence of this- you realize you are watching an unintentional comedy about a car voice terrorist.

PLOT: a couple of people are framed as terrorists and then chased everywhere unrealistically by the FBI/counterterrorism units.. all the while they are continually getting messages through any electronic device from a car GPS voice from hell that is a terrorist.

Once you realize what the plot vehicle is you might not be able to stop laughing as you think about sitting in a talking car and having it give you dumb directions like are in this movie.
