Gee, I wonder if a Matrix 5 is in the works..
I understand this is a graphic novel, and no I have not read it. But if the movie is remotely based on it, I just don't see who thought it could translate well to film. There was not a single original idea in this film. And to top it all off, you blow stuff up to the 1812 overture? Come on! Throw in CG motion trails on knives, and a love admission eerily reminiscent of the original Matrix, and this thing just overloads on cheese. The themes of good and evil, the symbolism is so over-explained and illustrated in this movie that it's almost insulting. Combine that with a ridiculous and overly simplistic plot and you get not only a numb backside, but a numb head as well. From the first moments of alliteration abuse, to the final tones of the 1812 overture, this movie is simply dull and fails to entertain. If you want to make a movie filled with anti-government and media propaganda, next time stick to a pamphlet in my opinion.
