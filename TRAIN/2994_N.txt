Had Great Potential
This movie is one of the countless that have come out of Hollywood that had great potential.

However, like so many personalities in Hollywood, it sold it's soul for a cheap finish.

There were some beautiful ideas in this movie, and it could of been great.

However, the producers chose to go for the cheap thriller effect, instead of exploring what truly makes us human or machine. Conceived, written, and produced by idiots with now soul.

Don't waste your time.

The only redeeming part of this movie was when the dweeb gets sent to the sticks, and is surprised when his smartphone tell him that there was no signal. The producers and writers of this piece of crap obviously had no signal also.
