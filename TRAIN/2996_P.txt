A wonderful sci-fi movie
I liked it a lot, it was really sci-fi and well done...it was confusing at times but it made sense in the end. if you like sci fi and/or Jennifer garner, you should watch this movie. the special effects are cool and it will have you quoting the movie for days. it's a sort of calm and quiet movie, when it's not an action scene. the action scenes were really awesome and contained some cool moves that will make you want to rewind and play, rewind and play...and then try yourself (which you shouldn't). Jennifer's acting is really well done, along with her co-stars, and you'll find yourself understanding the character from Daredevil more. you should only watch this movie if you are a fan of science fiction. if you love Jennifer garner, but hate science fiction, you might not want to watch Elektra. But this movie isn't quite like others; there's a different (in a good way) feel to it. If you watch the movie, i hope you enjoy it :D.
