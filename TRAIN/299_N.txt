Worst movie EVER
This is a HORRIBLE version of Pride and Prejudice. It portrays the characters nothing like the 1995 version or the book for that matter.  The film makes Lizzie out to be a silly, non-clever, dumb girl. Who only enjoys laughing and reading books. The end of the movie is what killed it for me. The "Godess Devine" scene is ridiculous and if Jane Austen was alive I'm sure she would be disgusted by it. It changes the WHOLE tone of the movie and you go away from the movie missing something.  Don't waste your time on the movie. Either read the book or watch the 1995 version of the film.  I have come across many people who enjoyed this version, but none of them have actually read the book or scene the 1995 version.
