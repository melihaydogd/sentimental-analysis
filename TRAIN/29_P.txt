A perfect 10 and here's why
I cannot recall a piece of work like this in my 40+ years of film viewing.There is absolutely nothing being sold to you here. It is what it is and it's left, almost, entirely up to you to make what you will of it.Hence the 10/10.There's no way I can critique or score this on any metrics I'd normally use as they're simply not relevant. This film critiques and scores you, not the other way around ...Kubrick? Well indeed, that guy's movies are riddled with a cold, unemotional "matter of factness" that leave them embedded in your mind for decades afterwards but this is on another level entirely.Being set in a Wintery Scotland didn't happen by chance, it matches the film's tone perfectly and, if you can, it's worth trying to watch it in a cold environment - that's the level of immersion on offer here but only if you can handle it (few will).How on earth this film ever got made I don't know, there's no way in hell it would ever get a green light in Hollywood so you have to give it up to all concerned as it's an absolutely stunning achievement.Scarlett Johansson puts in a pitch-perfect performance and I for one was glad to see some female nudity portrayed by someone who looks like she'd eaten a proper meal recently - all the more reason to give her credit in my opinion.In an industry obsessed with horrific stick-thin women, that wasn't lost on me and I think it was very brave of her to do what she did here. I don't like it when actresses do makeup and perfume adverts as I feel it diminishes their credibility as artists (and promotes them as just-another-painted-wh*re) and I was disappointed to see Scarlett in one of those but she more than claws back the respect with this effort ...If you liked Only God Forgives then try this for size but be warned, it makes that, wonderful, film feel like an Eddie Murphy effort ...
