Infantile garbage
Wow this movie really shows what Hollywood celebrity, a great marketing machine and money can achieve. This was the saddest excuse for a movie that I have had the misfortune of watching in a while.What a childish load of drivel. After all the hype it was a huge disappointment. There was nothing really funny about it - the best I can say is there were one or two mildly amusing moments and a couple of semi-decent action scenes but for the most part I found it more irritating than anything else. I can see what they were going for but it fell way short of the target.

It amazes me that this would appeal to the masses at all. It is basically an indictment of and an insult to viewers intelligence
