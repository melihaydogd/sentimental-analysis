Its fun movie but...
I love zombie movies, but it was hard to find good zombie movie from Asia. This one is good, but there is two thing which I want to share with you.1-tipicle Chinese stile movie- mix of saw, rec, biohazard etc dressed up with new CG technique. No originality at for scenes.2-subliminal anti japan propaganda- lot of money come from Chinese government so its normal, but lot of racism in Chinese language. I hate political indication in movies...watch it if you like zombie movies, its good for spent 80min during weekend night(but don't spend money for rent)
