A Hole in My Heart (2004)
Probably the most pointless and irritating watch since Gummo. The film has nothing to say, or anything entertaining to offer. We are assaulted by a stream of unconscious, disgusting visuals. The film is also mindlessly repetitive and just becomes like a scratched CD of some cheap erotica. Moodysson ventures into the world of the experimental, but instead, just insults everyone's intelligence. Art has to say something, and if it wants to depict the harshness of humanity, there should at least be some sort of emotional focus point. Without the emotion, it's just three people in a room, being disgusting. A good watch if you wish to feel empty.
