No interest
I've heard good things around this movie. So I was really excited to watch it. In the end, I honestly didn't enjoy it. I think it's because of the gimmick of everything being told backwards. By the first hour I was getting used to it, but I can't say I enjoyed this kind of storytelling. Since the viewer has seen the scenes that are the results of the next scenes. It didn't keep me interested.

Maybe if the charactets were interesting and I felt something for them maybe I could overlook it. But no. The main character is very uninteresting, and throughout the film I just don't care for his revenge story.

If you want to watch a good mystery thriller, I recommend Seven.
