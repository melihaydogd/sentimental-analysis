Awesome continuation from the original series
This film was one I had been wanting to see for a while. After being somewhat unimpressed with the newer editions of Yu-Gi-Oh!, I was concerned that this movie would not meet up to the expectations of its fans. Boy was I wrong! This film retained the magic of the original series (despite Atem's absence for most of it).
The storyline was novel and engaging. I also enjoyed the new gameplay elements that the dimension summoning added. It was really great to see the original gang back together again, with (who I assume to be) the original voice actors. The new characters were fun and had an interesting back story that only added to the lore of the original series.
Another great change was the animation. It was modernised and looked very crisp compared to the original series. In some places it looked odd, but that is because I don't really like the animation that tries to make something 2D look 3D (it was mainly for the monsters when they were summoned). It also made watching it feel a bit disjointed since there were different types of animation being utilised.
The film came to an excellent climax and did not disappoint. I just wish it was 15 minutes longer so we could see what happens after Atem gives Kaiba that grin!!
