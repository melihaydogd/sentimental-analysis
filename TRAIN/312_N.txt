Pixar and Disney have lost their touch
I feel, with the realese of this film as well as Frozen II, that both Disney and Pixar have lost their touch and the kingdom is no longer magic, it's just a kingdom that collects nothing but taxes.This movie had promise, but the cast, story and all around direction was dowb right horrendous and not what I'd expect from Disney or Pixar.How was Toy Story 4 so good, and this so freaking bad? Get it together Disney.
