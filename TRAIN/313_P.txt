Excellent Film
This film was very real, very honest, and extremely well cast. One doesn't have to be a Catholic to appreciate the story though being a teen or older will certainly help. A sensitive issue was masterfully handled without being preachy or condescending.
The film's length was a refreshing alternative to the plethora of movies that seem to subscribe to the theory that longer is better. This was just right, just long enough to tell the story but not too long that it became repetitive.
To everyone involved with this film, thank you!
