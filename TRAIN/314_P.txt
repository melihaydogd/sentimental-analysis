Would modestly recommend
V for Vendetta is very fun, upbeat, and entertaining. It's signature flaw is that it wants to be subversive, bold, and thoughtful, but it's more or less worthless on an intellectual level. Every point it makes is obvious and surprisingly averse to controversy. It contradicts itself on whether the ends should justify the means. It passes itself off as progressive by spending most of its runtime attacking right-wingers, in spite of the fact that it seems to be advocating libertarianism. It attacks cults of personality as the audience revels in V's awesomeness. I'd recommend it purely on an entertainment level, but I find it annoying when people make the film out to be meaningful.
