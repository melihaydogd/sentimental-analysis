Good Adaptation, Average Movie
The problem of V for Vendetta isn't the cast, the screenplay or the director. It's the source material. Don't get me wrong, the graphic novel is very good, but it works only as a graphic novel. The story is "more from the same". Another 1984-like England, another dictatorship (that could be right or left). It's the kind of story that works in an 80s comic book, and very well, but gets annoyingly repetitive in a modern movie. There are very good aspects, of course. The visual atmosphere is excellent, V is a very charismatic revolutionary (I won't call that a hero), even though we can't see his expressions and I admit I liked Evey better in the movie than in the graphic novel. But these good point don't make up to the feeling of dej√°-vu. It seemed a little too popcorn politics to me and, worst of all, old popcorn politics. And honestly, 10 years after I read the novel for the first time, I must say... 1984 isn't really that amazing.
