I hope Lilo kicks Chihiro's butt!!!!!
Call me old-fashioned but little things like plot and structure still mean something to me when I'm watching a movie.  Perhaps these minor little details simply got lost in the translation (perhaps they were spirited away... yuk, yuk, yuk). If so then I commend-albeit with heaps of skepticism- everyone who praised this movie for their cultural aptitude. If not, then shame on you for promoting this hapless drivel.   Yes, the animation was breath-taking, but am I the only one who didn't want to shoot cute little Chihiro (and everything else) after the first five minutes? Come on people! Who's with me? Am I the only one who wondered why Haku, the boy/dragon-dog/river/whatever, was almost killed by that flock of, what looked like, rabid confetti? And what was up with the bath tickets? And the giant monster baby?  Should I have gotten high before seeing this movie? I don't know, something tells me that it would have made the experience worse. Lilo and Stitch all the way baby!!!!!!!
