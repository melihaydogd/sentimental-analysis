Gratuitous Violence spoils attempt at interesting plot that simply doesn't work
Movie is well acted with good dialogue and an attempt at a good plot but this is what it looks like happened. Halfway through the director decided to turn the movie into a nonsensical ultra violence spectacle. The plot wound itself up into so many knots that what you were left with was widespread carnage making this viewer needing a few drinks to get over the pain. Next day. still feeling Post Traumatic Movie Syndrome, I feel a need to warn everyone away from this movie.

DO NOT watch this movie! It starts out pretending to be interesting and just winds up with a massive body count for no reason.

Disgusting use of good talent.
