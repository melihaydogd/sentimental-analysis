Primarily for those who own the album
I guess all Pink Floyd fans are praising this film because they enjoy watching a visualization of their favourite songs. If I had listened to the album first (and it would definetely take quite a few listenings to get into it), I am sure I would have liked the movie. I respect both Alan Parker's work and Pink Floyd's music in general, yet I found this movie utterly boring; in addition, the symbolisms are too simplistic and the messages that got through to me are all too heard-before. Maybe it would have worked better if it had been made as a unique project from the start - maybe then the music would have served the images. Because now it seems that the images serve the music - it doesn't happen the other way around simultaneously.  I wouldn't dare comment on music that hasn't "grown" on me, but the film as a whole told me very little.  3
