So much potential, but left me wanting more.
I have to say, as soon as I saw the trailer for this I loved the concept. The start was promising and had me examining every single second and being deeply involved im the movie. The second and eve of the third act were good, but ultimately it was the ending that ruined it for me.

So much information left out, more questions arise than answer are given, and surely we end up wanting more, but here unfortunately is where it ends.

Surely they could have added another half an hour and tie it up nicely, at least explaining who this organisation is, what is on the top, and how can they even offer diplomas, what powers do they have exactly?

And probably the simplest thing is - why can't the protagonist just go on the platform the next day like the girl did, why does he HAVE to die??

Hope for a sequel but doubt it.
