The Hip-hop Great Gatsby
G, The Hip-hop Great Gatsby opened the Kansas Film Festival and I got a ticket. I'm not at all a fan of Hip-hop (although Hustle and Flow was terrific!). Regardless "G" is great! Keep in mind the question the Journalist (narriator) asks everyone, "Does Hip-hop have heart?". He finally gets an answer with the last line of the movie. Richard T. Jones was mesmerizing as a "Puffy" Rap Mougel slumming in the Hamptons. If your definition of evil is selfishness carried to its logical conclusion then Blair Underwood played a true monster. Great acting job since he is such a sweet person. The movie is a bit uneven in some of the pacing and the reason why the female lead, Sky does what she does is puzzling but an extremely good-looking cast and a great soundtrack make this a movie to watch for. Writer-director Christopher Scott Cherot was at the film and gave a 30 minute Q&A on what he went through to raise the money and get the film made is so good that I hope he will repeat it on the DVD. You can tell when a studio has over-processed a film more than Spam and this is Cherot's film from star to finish. Even if you don't like Hip-Hop see it.
