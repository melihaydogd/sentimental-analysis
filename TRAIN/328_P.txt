Can I enjoy the acting without being enticed by the story
Look, I'm a 23 year old with no kids or wife. The acting by dean was superb. The story was actually pretty good and the director did a phenomenal job. A lot of good shots and engrossing scenes but my complaint was I couldn't connect with it on the level I feel I should. Dean definitely tried his best and I wanted to be but I just felt a little less emotional about this film than some of the other viewers. Also maybe a good 10 or 15 min shorter probably would have been better
