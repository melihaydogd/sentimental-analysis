Movie or Doco?
Great lover of Spy books/movies I was looking forward to this film. While it was well acted, and I daresay relatively close to actual events, I felt more like I was watching a well produced documentary on the History channel than being entertained by an engrossing movie. It was worth the admission, just, but a little drawn out in parts and not quite up to more memorable films of this genre.
