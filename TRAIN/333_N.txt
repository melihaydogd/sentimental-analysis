Bland, ineffective, an offense to it's story
A tragic true story told as generic, mundane and formulaic as possible. Alan Turing is known as a hero to some, yet here he is portrayed like a robot wearing a Benedict Cumberbatch costume that can shed tears when the screenplay allows for it. A screenplay that follows an out-dated guide on how to make an Academy Award winning film.

For such an amazing story filled with inspiration and sadness, the filmmakers didn't bother to make any other aspect of the film daring, inventive or even slightly original. Almost every part of this production could have passed as a movie-of-the-week on some major television network. Even the soundtrack is bland, it's as black and white as the over-used stock war footage.

A film portraying a story like this, especially it being a true story, should rip the heart out of it's audience, having them leaving the theater disgusted, heart-broken and angry. Instead, what we get here, is a film that rushes through everything, while watering it down, all to fit a family-friendly rating and a run-time of no longer than 2 hours. This leaves the film absolutely ineffective and it's audience indifferent. And that's the worse possible out-come of a film telling such an important, meaningful and provocative true story.
