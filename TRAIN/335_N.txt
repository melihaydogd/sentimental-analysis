Boring

I am trying to say something positive about this film, but I cannot. It was like a body without a soul; empty, blank, hollow.. The acting was probably amazing, I say probably, because one could interpret the wooden performances as being intentional. The characters were not endearing whatsoever, and half way through I got the feeling this was as "good" as it gets. Really really disappointed, and feel as though this film could have given so much more. I understand the arthouse / Greek tragedy side of things, and yes, it was interesting in the way this was portrayed, but at least inject a small amount of life into this zombie of a movie.
