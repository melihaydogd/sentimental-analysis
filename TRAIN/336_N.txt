Totally avoidable
This is one of those movies that the IMDb rating tricks you into believing is better than it actually is. The IMDb synopsis also makes you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some sort of &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in contrast and are actually watchable. This movie is plain painful to watch.
