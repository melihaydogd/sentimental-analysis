Random jokes and baka characters.
Funny comedy with lots of random jokes and baka characters that made me laugh so hard a few times. The main character puts so much energy and passion in his garage band it's easy to feel so much sympathy for him despite how stupid the songs are.

On the other hand there's an idol played by Fumi Nikaido who finds value in those losers after watching them play in a random concert. She feels free from her life as an Idol after kicking the singer from the stage and stealing the show.

These are two characters with very different purposes in the world of music that develop a wonderful bond throughout the movie.

The ending was a bit underwhelming though, it has been done too many times before and I just didn't see the movie going in that direction. I also felt like Naoto Takenaka was underused.

All in all, it's a fun movie for what is it. The humour, the band and the important role of a kawaii girl are very reminiscent of "Brass Knuckle Boys" starring Aoi Miyazaki.
