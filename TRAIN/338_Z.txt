I Don't Get It
I don't get it! How can this movie be rated 8.2? Yes the filming and visual effects were stunning, but the movie was flat out boring. The story is old and over played and the entire movie seemed like a cross between Castaway and Payback.

DiCaprio's character gets attacked by a bear, buried alive, rides a horse off of a cliff, careens down a freezing river and gets stabbed, but still survives. Wow, how exciting.

And to think that he can even be nominated by an academy award is amazing. He grunted through the entire film and when he finally could speak, he did a bad impression of Marlin Brando in the Godfather.

Don't waste your money or time (lots of time) on this movie.
