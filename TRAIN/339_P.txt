Smart but nothing else
I like to start my review by saying that I don't think this is an enjoyable movie which doesn't mean it is at all bad, I thought it was very good actually. The story is what stands out, it's very unique and the way it is presented is great although it is rather slow throughout. For me it was a bit boring as it was straight dialogue for two hours, but it did all lead to a dramatic ending which was quite satisfying yet a bit confusing. Most Christopher Nolan movies are quite confusing though so I did expect this when coming into it and I did understand what happened I don't feel like I was truly able to take in so much knowledge in at once and it left me a bit baffled. The acting was pretty good, nothing stood out to me neither did the music used and it wasn't that tense but the idea as a whole was great and that is pretty much the only reason I give this higher than a five, the story. I wish it were showed in a different way or just readjusted to better suit the high percentage of slightly idiotic people watching the movie, which I feel like I fall under that category after watching this. I give this seven for it's cleverness alone.
