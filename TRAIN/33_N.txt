Really, Really, Really BAD
I can't believe all the good reviews. I just saw this dreadful movie. Mind you, I'm a movie buff, and love all types of movies. This was not only bad, I would say it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And for Scarlett Johannsen fans, she looks so ugly, so fat, so insipid, that it must hint at the fact that her career isn't going where it should be. I can't believe she would appear in such a piece of trash. Sorry, this was so bad that I don't know where to start.I saw her on Broadway a few seasons ago in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, and she was sensational. I was really surprised, because I've never really cared for her. Yes, she has sexy lips, but her voice is so flat and one-dimensional that I'd never understood all the uproar about her supposed incredible talent. In Don Jon, she was supposed to be a shrill witch, and she did the part very well. So I thought, "yes, the woman can act."But now this. I just don't understand. She must command a very high salary, and must be able to pick and choose her assignments. So why would she waste her talent on this? And especially looking so hideous with that ugly black wig and, as stated before, with a belly and love handles that perhaps the director wanted her to have? Terrible move, ludicrous premise, horrible acting, horrendous filmography, mamma mia, non capisco niente........
