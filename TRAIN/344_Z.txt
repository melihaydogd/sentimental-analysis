Below expectations
Despite the spectacular reviews this film is receiving, i can't help myself but feeling disappointed about the outcome of this long awaited remake. In my opinion Jackson is trying to hard to make anything just right for the fans. He devotes over an hour in character development, but the characters don't develop in any way, 15 Minutes would have been enough to make a point. Jackson demands over an hour from the audience to proof that he just isn't the right one for the drama-department. Even worse are the films ambitions to make totally sure that the giant ape has to be likable and that there is a deep relationship between it and Watts. Watching the scene, when both have oh so cute fun on a frozen lake made me feel treated like an emotional underdeveloped idiot. Jackson really pushes too hard to make the story tragic. I mean, everybody knows after a while that the ape is a gentle creature and that it is sad when it has to be shot but the director almost forces the audience into tears. That's really cheap. Another point i really can't comprehend is how bad some of the cinematography is, when no special effects are involved. Is this second unit stuff or why are the fight scenes with the natives filmed in this cheap motion track technique? These scenes look like stolen from some odd 90s Hong Kong action-flicks. However they are destroying the well build tension that led up to the confrontation with the hilarious ugly bushmen. Unbelievably with all his love and respect for the original Jackson has accomplished a giant leap back in motion pictures history and has made the most expensive movie with a "man-in-a- gorilla-suit" in it. Still recommended for its formidable cast and the really nightmarish insect-pit sequence.
