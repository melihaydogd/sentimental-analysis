A rather milquetoast, yet sweet summer diversion (+ 'Newman' is in it)
This was kind of the typical Hollywood trainwreck movie. Put it another way: I know of a childhood neighbor-friend who would love it - his tastes in TV and movies being different than mine. Many of the scenarios in the movie seem either implausible or outright morally wrong. Any father I know from the 1960's would NEVER let their daughter run around amongst a bunch of adults!! This movie takes place at a summer retreat for wealthy families, and 'baby' (Jennifer Grey) is a rich doctor's daughter. She becomes infatuated with one of the dance instructors / entertainers at this retreat, despite some objections from her family. Patrick Swayze's acting is terrible. Dittos to Jennifer Grey. In addition to conning her father to get abortion money for one of the dancers, her doctor-father (Jerry Orbach) seems very progressive in his attitudes for the 1960's. Another disappointment is that there simply isn't a whole lot of dancing.
