Euthanasia should be a given right for everybody. Every country that is against that right is a farce for democracy.
You Don't Know Jack is a long movie but it never feels long, in fact it could have been longer for me, as for that the biographical story is too important and debatable (or not). Logically it's a farce that it's debatable because everybody should be able to make the decision to end his own life or not, and certainly when you are incurably sick and in a lot of pain. Nobody deserves neverending pain, nobody deserves to live like a plant if they don't wish to. What Jack Kevorkian did should be normal, without even questioning, like it's done in many other countries where you can die with dignity. Again religion and absurd laws dictate the American juridical system, a system with laws that are antiquated and that make no sense at all anymore. So yes the movie is an important and interesting story. It's well made with a great cast that all contributed to make this movie more than enjoyable. Al Pacino is excellent in this movie, in a role that we're not used to see him, but where he proves he's a great actor that can play different characters. I thought it was one of his best performances. You Don't Know Jack is about the courageous doctor Jack Kevorkian, a man that didn't deserve to be put behind bars, not even one day. Very good emotional movie, not easy to watch for everybody, certainly not if you saw somebody close rot in pain until his last breath. In conclusion I wish everybody that is against euthanasia to die in a long terrible and painful way, see if you like it then.
