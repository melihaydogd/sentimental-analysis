It's saying a lot, but not in a way that connects
Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks alone in West Texas desert. He has been missing for four years, leaving behind his son to be raised by his brother. Then he is discovered, joins back with society and must confront his old ghosts and regrets in order to make it up to his son.  Stanton's performance carries this movie far. The struggle of his character feels real and when he finally comes to grips with this past sins, it is a very well put together scene.  Unfortunately, it's a lot of buildup before we get to that scene and I don't think it's quite worth it. The first act especially, when we have no idea what's going on, who these characters are or what they're all about, is agonizingly slow. And even though the film picks up the pace somewhat in the second and third act, it's still very slow. Which is not a demerit in and on itself, but there always has to be something to keep up your interest and I think that this film fails in that regard.  Not the worst movie by any means, and I do see why some people hail it as a classic, but it was very much not my cup of tea.
