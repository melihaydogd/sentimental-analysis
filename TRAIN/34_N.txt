just awful
the only reason i rented this was cuz my wife expressed interest in seeing it, i really had no desire, but i watched it anyway, what a waste of 2 hours plus. i usually don't comment on movies here but this was without a doubt the worst movie I've seen all year, and i watched several Bruce Campbell films. the acting was horrible and the story was just stupid, there are far too many problems to addressed all of them, the ending was totally cheesy, wow, a whole nation is gonna put on masks and stand against the evil empire, corny and cheesy, even the action wasn't that great, saw it the first time the W brothers did it in the Matrix movies. please tell em there wont be a sequel, ugh just awful, and a 8.3 average?!!!! so long as it has a big explosion at the end that warrants a high rating? i guess so. the movie viewing public is obviously devoid of any ability to adequately criticize a movie.
