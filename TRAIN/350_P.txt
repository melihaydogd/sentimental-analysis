I enjoyed it!
Finally after 3 years I saw it, and I must say I really enjoyed it. The movie starts off quite well, however it definitely falls flat a bit at the end, but it's entertaining and worth watching. It has a decent length and it's well made and it has a good plot. As for the concept of horror ... MEH ... it's not really horror, it has a little bit of horror but nothing spectacular, and I wouldn't put it under the category of horror. I loved all the characters, especially the character of Magik (Anya Taylor-Joy), it's a shame that we won't see these characters and their stories anymore since it is the closing chapter of the X-Men saga with FOX. Probably all the delays that occurred with this movie affected it in one way or another, especially because most of the people will expect too much and be disappointed, but give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is. At least it's WAY better than X-men Dark Phoenix.
