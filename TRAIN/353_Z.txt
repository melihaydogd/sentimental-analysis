What is the buzz about?
Greetings from Lithuania.  "Persona" (1966) is an art movie from start till finish. But the problem is that this type of "art" is not for me - for the whole running time 1 h 23 min this movie dragged beyond believe. Some might say it contains a lot of hidden meanings - so what if at the end of the day of don't give a damn about it. Only good thing about this "art" movie i can say that i liked performances by both leads. Other then that - i would give up all the secrets to the spies if they would interrogate me by forcing me to watch this movie one time again.  Overall, "Persona" is a high level of character study movie, but pretentious is the right word for it - it tried to achieve something only that the creator would have loved it and at the end i do not understand this "masterpiece" at all. Huge disappointment.
