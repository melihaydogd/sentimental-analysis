Overly long and quite mediocre
The story of Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. Focuses on her relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.

Mediocre, but an epic in every sense. Incredibly long at over 4 hours, and overly so. Too detailed, yet misses character depth.

On the plus side - great sets and costumes. Considering that this was before CGI, the backdrops are amazing.

Interesting from an historical perspective, and reasonably accurate.

Dialogue is verbose, and makes the 4 hours seem even longer.

Probably the most interesting thing about the movie is this is where the Burton-Taylor combination (on and off the screen) started.
