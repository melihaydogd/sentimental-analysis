Disappointed...
Just saw this movie, this is a first impression. The acting was good but the scenario had some flaws. there was a lot of talking and nice quotes for a political statement that just didn't pack the punch. Too long, too slow and nothing breath taking or jaw dropping. I was waiting for the final cut or the big surprise behind the whole thing and was honestly disappointed in the end. The logic of the characters is hard to follow and the 'mix' between the action and political drama did not bode well. It could of been a great action movie or a great political thriller, not a hybrid... As for the action, it was great, nice camera work and good effect but the scenario didn't follow...
