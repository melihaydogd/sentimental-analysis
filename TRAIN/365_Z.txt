I enjoyed the cartoon and talked my husband, daughter and 3 grandkids to go and see with me. They all enjoyed it. My daughter (33 yrs old) was disappointed at the end because she was just getting into it. Safe to say she had no idea previously what the story was about. We are hoping they come out with the next two books. I thought Sokka, Ang, and Katara were well cast.I thought that Prince Zuko was not at all what i pictured. Uncle Iron was an enigma for me. While I totally enjoyed him in the movie, he diverged a great deal from what his character is in the animated series. I would have definitely liked to see more of the parts that were totally missing from Book One series in animation. Nevertheless, as stated in the beginning, we are definitely going to see Book 2 and 3 if they are made.
