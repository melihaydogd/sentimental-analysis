Brilliant!
I decided to go see Earth to Echo at the cinema with my friends and I knew by the trailers that it would be good. It's based on around about the same story-line as ET, however, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The movie was presented well, and was shown in the characters point of view, I would recommend this to the whole family! I know there's been lots of bad reviews but the movie overall was fantastic, it also had a good tale of friendship with the characters. Echo is an amazing alien and I loved his character. It's one of my favorite movies to be honest, I also like how the kids are blogging the whole film, I rate this 10/10!
