Pretty sad that this is considered great
This movie was HARD to pay attention to. It was confusing. So I chose to watch it again, because I wasn't paying attention. I still didn't get what was so great about it. I payed attention and I think it's overrated. 4/10, go rent a better movie, like Magnolia.
