Weak imitation of a great story
I was so eager to see the movie because of its all positive reviews, but boy, how misguided was I feeling when it turned out to be nothing that I expected. The film sets 12 years in the future where are no mutants born in over two decades, aging and alcoholic Logan tries to get along driving his limo and together with the albino mutant tracker Caliban taking care of Professor X somewhere in Mexico. Logan is supposed to take the young girl Laura Kinney to a refuge called Eden. But then the bio-tech firm Alkali-Transigen's head security comes and tries to take Laura, who turns out to be a blood clone of Logan, one of many other clones that are now in hiding. with today's technology and yesterday's music nothing gives the feeling that this is the future.

All the forced cursing and unnecessary slaying of humans is just hard to watch. The X-men never was like this. In the fighting scenes Laura Kinney, played by fresh face Dafne Keen, sure does well all the already clich√©d typical Marvel manoeuvres, just like little Black Widow. When she finally starts to talk, all I felt was embarrassed by the lacking quality of her acting. Naturally Logan is a jerk, but when the only character I felt any compassion for is Caliban, played by Stephen Merchant, I knew I'm not getting what I'm looking for. The bad guys are weak, and not even the ending didn't make me feel any sympathy for the lead characters. The simple plot is just a weak attempt to imitate the great story of the Old Man Logan comic book. The emotions I was feeling watching the film were boredom, frustration and anger. There just aren't any grounds for all the praise, whatsoever. Logan is just a perfect example of another overrated Marvel movie, right there beside Deadpool and Guardians Of The Galaxy films.
