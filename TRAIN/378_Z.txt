Great effects and acting but lacking depth in the plot
I really looked forward to this movie. The trailer was fascinating with a mirror that supposedly had a 400 year history of bizarre deaths of it's owners.The good things first. The effects were really scary. Also, I found the acting top notch and very believable by both the adults and the children. This is what carries the movie.However, most of the movie takes place in the same house in two time periods. One is now when the two siblings have grown up, the other when the parents were killed. The fact that the plot involves few other people than the the two siblings and the parents give it a budget like feeling. Also, there are several logical inconsistencies, which I wont't go into the details of, as it would introduce spoilers. Suffice it to say that there were several places where I would spontaneously say: "why don't you ... instead". These things make the movie lacking in depth and believability.
