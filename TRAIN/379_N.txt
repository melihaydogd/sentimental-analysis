Terrible
I came into this movie with low expectations. I'm a massive fan of the F&F franchise and have no issues with nonsense dialogue and thin plot - as long as it's entertaining i'm easy to please.

But boy, this is another level.

Characters - I could not care less about any of them if I tried. The English woman was just awful. Truly, awful. Kid Cudi was just painfully unfunny. Lead character (Aaron Paul) wasn't any better. Definitely not leading man material. Should stick to "geeky best friend" roles.

Script - Just unfunny and so cheesy. Switched constantly from "emotional" scenes (that just don't work) to action scenes (that are all a bit stale and have been done before). Kid Cudi randomly managing to get hold of all manner of air transport as if picking up a newspaper is just lame. Having to refuel "on the go" as they were pushed for time - but then spending the next 10 minutes drifting round a small town to scare the English girl, makes no sense.

And the killer for me - the cars. Being a car movie, you expect the cars to steal the show but we are treated to some American muscle that has been seen before. The Shelby mustang just came over as a massive ad for Ford motor co. And the sound of them was just terrible. I expected turbo whistle, the crackle of anti-lag, screaming engines and the throb of V8's. Didn't get it. All the cars sounded fake. Not once did anything rev over 5k. Plenty of tire squeal though if that's your thing.

Left me cold.

Any of the F&F movies does this so much better. Even the bad ones ;)
