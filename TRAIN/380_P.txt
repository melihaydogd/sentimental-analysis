Meets national minimum wage.
Life is cheap out in the Old West, unless you're a bounty hunter, in which case it's a profitable way to make a living. With so many roustabouts getting up to no good it was inevitable that Indio, the biggest and baddest of all, would attract the attention of two men with very different motives.  Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (Eastwood) eventually cross paths and form a tenuous partnership to catch Indio, who has just been broken out of jail by his loyal men and is planning a big bank robbery. Mortimer and Monco work together, and against each other, in order to bring him in, and all his men, to maximize their rewards.  It's a long film, but it has enough time to indulge in over-the-top moments. I especially like Clint and Van Cleef squaring up to each other by shooting hats. It's ridiculous, but good. Some of the widescreen photography is particularly memorable. It's all grainy, gritty stuff but it's a rough edge you just don't get anymore, which is a loss to modern movie which all just look too slick.  Ennio Morricone also provides a wonderful score that's utterly timeless and turns many scenes into an overblown opera.  I'm in the mood for Spaghetti now.
