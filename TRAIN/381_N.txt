Waste of time.
This is not a documentary. It's a 90min movie review by a bunch of irrelevant "critics" spouting their irrelevant opinions no one cares about and no one asked for. They sit around pontificating the meaning behind every little thing and how the movie is full of "misogyny" and "racism". None of which is true. Most of the commentary is done by basement dweller Schmader the schmuck from back in 2004/05. Don't even get me started on that. There is also a section devoted to some strange woman, who is a nobody, running around town obsessed with Elizabeth Berkeley and apparently there are idiots who think she's funny when really she's just cringe. NO ONE involved in SHOWGIRLS has anything to do with this load of bile. Wait for the real documentary, "GODDESS".
