Loved them both
As a huge fan of the original movie and a Latina, I really loved this version. I can understand some reviews about the two main characters not having chemistry. At first it was uncomfortable watching but they definitely grew on me. Most of the bad reviews are people who hate remakes and "Hollywood this" and "Hollywood that". In my opinion that really has nothing to do with the movie and the content. I really enjoyed this movie!
