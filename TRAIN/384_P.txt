A documentary well done
If you are going to do a documentary, this is a great one to use as a template. It was very informative and really gave accurate and insightful information. It was creative and showed heart. It gave the audience a satisfaction, even though it was not known what the result was. First of all, using personal stories was the key. This gave the audience something to root for. The families in Scotland really had a voice and were able to be part of something that meant something. I can appreciate the crew for what they did with this project. They helped those who were being exploited. This documentary was so powerful, it changed history and presently, Trump lost this battle and the right people one. Congrats to this documentary for meaning something!
