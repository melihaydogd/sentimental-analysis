Kill off Iris and make sure she days dead
This used to be a great show for the first 3 seasons. I barely made it through season 4 before I dropped the show completely. Iris fills no role other than being an annoying, useless control freak. So do the right thing CW and kill her. Don't bring her back through some wibbily wobbly timey wimey...stuff. Just kill her and deliver us from her.
