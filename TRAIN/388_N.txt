one of the worst movies i have ever seen.
What else can i say? This is maybe the crappiest movie i have ever viewed. It sucks so much, i dont even know if i would consider it a movie. It is like a bad high school play that was taped. I actually owned this movie at one point. I sold it to an entertainment store for one dollar and was damn happy to get that dollar for it. Terrible!
