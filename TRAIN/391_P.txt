The Return of the R Rater Superhero Movie
Deadpool isn't your typical mainstream comic book character, he is rude, crude, violent and not for the kids. And this movie encompasses everything that has made Wade Wilson an unforgettable comic book icon. 

Deadpool is one part origin story, one part love story and whole lot of ass kicking action. It's humor is unmatched in this genre and it is my belief that after the movie's release you won't be able to escape the Deadpool's grip on popular culture.

While the film's villains are definitely its weakest parts, their is a plethora of things to love in this film so it's easy to look past them. The highlight are X-men guest stars Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (picked solely based on her name). Deadpool interacting with the heroic X-Men was definitely my favorite part and really gets you excited for the inevitable sequel. 

Deadpool is a superhero film we have yet to see grace the big screen and let's hope it starts a new trend of adult orientated superhero films.
