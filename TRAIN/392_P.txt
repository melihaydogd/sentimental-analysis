If you're a John Rambo fan you'll love it
Sylvester Stallone, a thin plot, the Mexican Cartel, lots of inventive ways to make enemies dead, it&#39;s an absolute cracker. Don&#39;t listen to critics who are for some reason looking for something different from a Rambo movie. This is Rambo for Rambo fans.
