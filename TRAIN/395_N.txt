If this was a 20m college film, it would have been amazing.
The film is full of itself. It pounds the same imagery in to your brain over and over and over again. WE GET IT. (and you're not being clever at all)If the movie had been twenty minutes long I would be applauding it. Instead we get and rinse- and-repeat dullard that is painful to watch.I knew I was in trouble when the opening scene (beyond the 2001-esque opener) was watching a motor-cycle slowly traverse a curved road. Left to right, no mystery, just watch it drive. WATCH ALL OF ITS JOURNEY. Yes, you're establishing pace. The thing is, it never moves any faster, FOR THE ENTIRE FILM.Many will shout that it's art and deep storytelling. Metaphors galore. (eye-roll) There is nothing that elegant here. With all the repetitive messages, you'll know what's going on within the first thirty-minutes then hope it comes to end SOON. What we have instead is a series of highly provocative ideas and sub-texts, good for around twenty-minutes of story telling, spread out over two-hours. In the end, pay the 'sub' fee for Mister Skin to see Scarlett's naughty bits. Because that's all this flick is worth.
