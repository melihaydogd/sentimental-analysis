Give this film a chance, It is well done for American audiences
After watching the original first, then this film, I would recommend it to anyone. Especially if you haven't seen the original.I thought Spike Lee did a good job of keeping the original essence of the film and making tweaks to appeal to American audiences. I thought the acting and fight scenes were well done. Why not give this movie a chance? Don't let the purists ruin it for you. It's a well done film, based on a great original idea.If you have seen the original "girl with the dragon tattoo", then watched the remake, I would liken it to that. In the aspect of keeping it quite similar but making the appropriate tweaks.
