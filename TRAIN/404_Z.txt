Obviously Unoriginal But Fun To Watch
It was pretty obvious that this movie was another stalker movie. But all that aside, it was fun to watch Nia Long and Omar Epps working together again. Nothing unique about the plot, but it was so corny lmao. I enjoyed it. I'd watch this over a Tyler Perry movie any day.
