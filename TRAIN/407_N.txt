If The Matrix, Moon, Independence Day, & Terminator made a love baby, this is what would be born.
I found myself forcing movement during this film to ensure I didn't collapsed out of my seat under the immensely slow pace that this film goes at. Not only that, but it's far too predictable & has more holes than the Pope's socks! Sadly, it was a shocking film and I'm now searching to see how I can gain 2hrs of my back which were lost watching this.It really was like plot thieves had come in and written a piece of work that was sliced together from The Matrix, Moon, Independence Day & Terminator. The only decent part of the film, or one that I did actually sit up and pay attentive attention to was at the end, while Cruise plays the flight tape recorded of the NASA flight that found the alien ship; now that, was some good five minutes of my life. Really enjoyed it and would have liked to have seen more of that. Oh and be aware, there's the cheesiest entrance to this film that's like a very bad aftershave advert for "old man river's cent".I'd wait until it's on Sky as it's so slow, it would help with that Sunday roast laze that happens to us all.
