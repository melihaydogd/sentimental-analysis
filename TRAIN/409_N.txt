Will is alone and so is this story
Movie even though it is an action type, doesn't seem that way. After watching it, I can say that all the action is nullified by the amount of Will's time to get into a character. Zombies weren't that great, also. Story is almost generic. The type you'd see on a cereal box, or a cheap comic. Also very poorly executed. Maybe Will feels like a legend, but the movie script sure doesn't sound nor look like one. But I recommend you to see it, because it will give you inspiration for your own movie script, because this one is full of plot holes the size of football stadium.

Skip it if you can, story is badly told.
