One of the ten worst movies ever
I can only imagine that those who like this film find appeal in the violence.  It certainly isn&#39;t in the direction or story-telling.  It&#39;s an incredibly badly-written and episodic piece, full of irrelevant scenes without which it would only be an hour long.  What is relevant makes no use of the medium.  Characters are not introduced through telling actions, but by introducing themselves in some kind of criminal job-interview. Tarantino&#39;s &#39;genius&#39; seems to be a habit of having the lowest sort of people engaged in violent pursuits converse as casually as ladies at tea.  It&#39;s a trick he uses and re-uses in all his films.  Maybe Reservoir Dogs was meant to have deconstructionist elements a la From Dusk Till Dawn, but I think it&#39;s just what it appears to be:  a really bad film.<br/><br/>William Bell
