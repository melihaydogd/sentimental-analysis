Outstanding, hilarious, a must see!
David Zucker has outdone himself. Of all the great movies he has done, An American Carol is the best. Extremely funny from start to finish. I loved the protest scenes and the O'reilly interview with Michael and Rosie O'Donnell. It was great to see Leslie Nielson again, a Zucker standard bearer. Kevin Farley was sensational in playing Michael Malone. He did his late brother proud, in the family comic tradition. Kelsey Grammar was outstanding as General Patton. The plantation scene was incredible. Look for the many gyrations on Michael Malone's face. The one terrorist, don't know his name, but he blew me away with his comic delivery and timing. He was kind of a modern day Curly or Lou Costello. My favorite part was the ending, but don't want to do a spoiler here. No matter your political persuasion, you will love this movie. A must see for anyone and everyone.
