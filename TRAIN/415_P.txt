It was a decent movie overall
The plot does fall into predictability, and I just fear that the film is a little too tense for children. That said, it is a decent and fun film. The pace skips along fairly quickly, though some parts felt a tad too rushed, and there are some witty parts in the script. The special effects though were close to outstanding, especially the fireworks display gone wrong and the enormous Transformers-style robot. The acting is okay, Zach Galifianakis is the most impressive, but Bill Nighy the great actor he is is given very little to do as the supposed villain. It is the voice cast that impresses more though, with lively turns from particularly Sam Rockwell, Penelope Cruz and Jon Favreau. Nicolas Cage was flat out unrecognisable as Speckles I admit. Plus the animated characters are quite cute. On the whole this is a decent film. 7/10 Bethany Cox
