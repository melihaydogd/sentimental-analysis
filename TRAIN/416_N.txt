Ineffective parody
Michael Moore and his brand of documentaries is an area ripe for parody. unfortunately, the Zucker brothers aren't the guys to do it. Their low-brow slapstick might have worked in the 1980's, but I thin audiences are a little too sophisticated for it now.

As someone who probably disagrees with Michael Moore on nearly everything, the reality is that he doesn't hate America or the troops. He hates certain aspects of our government and disagrees with the war in Iraq (is there anyone at this point who still thinks that was a good idea?)

The comedy is that a Moore clone is visited by the ghosts of General Patton and George Washington, and learns the error of his ways. HOw, exactly? Okay, this is a comedy, but even Scrooge had to learn the error of his ways by seeing that he was wrong. Where does Malone do so?

The movie does have some funny moments in it, but most of it is repetitive fat jokes, slapstick, and the tired "well, he only won for a documentary" joke.
