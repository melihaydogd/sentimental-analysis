Nice and fun
When Busby Berkeley moved from Warner Brothers to MGM he wanted to be directing straight dramatic items as well as musicals. MGM obliged him with this Fast And Furious which in its 70 minute running time lives up to its name.Franchot Tone and Ann Sothern play a married lawyer and wife who works as secretary and they look as playful and hip as Nick and Nora Charles. In fact Tone is asked to be a judge at an oceanside beauty pageant (Atlantic City in all but name) and sees this as a dream vacation. He throws an investment into the pageant and their friend Lee Bowman throws a lot more.Which is in danger of being lost when it comes to their attention that the organizer John Miljan is going skip with the pageant money without wife Ruth Hussey and with contestant Mary Beth Hughes. In fact Bowman confronts Miljan who winds up shot to death and Bowman looking good for it.That's when Tone goes to work to clear his friend Bowman. I have to confess I had it wrong in terms of the eventual murderer and that's when I like a mystery.It's a B film from MGM, but their product would be a big budget item at Monogram or PRC. Tone and Sothern register well as a fun married couple. They have two good scenes, a harrowing one when they are in an elevator shaft and nearly crushed and a rather extended encounter with lion tamer Frank Orth and his 3 lions who are staying at the hotel. They must have one liberal guest policy.Fast And Furious is the pace of the film and a fun film it is.
