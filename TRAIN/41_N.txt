I wish I read some reviews before watching

This was a complete illogical mess from beginning to end! I am so mad to have wasted almost two hours of my life over this! Most of the scenes and dialogues were so cringeworthy!! This rivals REDLINE as one of the worse movies I've ever seen and ever made! Netflix needs to do better with their movies! Most of the shows are greats but it's like they don't even bother with some Movies!
