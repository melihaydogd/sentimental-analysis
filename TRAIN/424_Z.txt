Not at all memorable
After seeing glowing reviews like: 5/5 The Guardian - 98%Rotten Tomatoes4/4Roger Ebert I thought this movie MUST be great! (or at least fairly good). After sitting through a slow building first half the movie just fizzed out. No real tension and very bland. Not at all memorable ... many better movies out there. All the soaring review have me utterly perplexed ...
