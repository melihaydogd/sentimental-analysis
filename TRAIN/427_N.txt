Stuck in a Public Toilet
My god this was a horrible flick.

It mainly consisted of beautiful filming, heavy breathing, and a dumb as a sponge character.

Dr Stone keeps on blithering "I am running out of oxygen" but she just babbles, fidgets and keeps babbling instead of just relaxing and breathing slowly as an astronaut would be trained to do

This character was a joke. She could not get out of a public toilet cubicle if she locked herself in it.

The only redeeming character was Matt Kowalski but then there were really only two characters in the movie.

I should have just watched Vanishing Point again.
