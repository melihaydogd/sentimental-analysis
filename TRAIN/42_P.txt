Decent, entertaining enough, NOT boring!
This was a short, charming and nonsensical movie which I really enjoyed. There are lots of good laugh scenes, and the plot keeps moving at a fast enough pace.There were some cute quirks in the story line itself that made the movie and characters even more enjoyable, despite the rest of the plot being fairly predictable.Michael Caton, who played the mad animal doctor, was absolutely hilarious. Rob Schneider does a really good portrayal of Marvin, the goofy wannabe police officer whose life is saved by getting rebuilt with animal parts after a big accident. He's definitely a funny actor who pulls off this type of roll well, and with impeccable timing.  Marvin's love interest, played by Colleen Haskell, delivered her lines ok enough but the chemistry didn't really seem to be there between the two. The Rianna character definitely had the potential to be one of the more interesting characters, but most scenes with her in it had Marvin stealing (or saving) the scene.All in all,  this is a really fun comedy and delivers a laughable viewing experience.  Of course it's completely unbelievable at times, but that just adds to the amusement if you let it.  Don't expect it to make sense,  just sit back, be entertained, and get ready to laugh!
