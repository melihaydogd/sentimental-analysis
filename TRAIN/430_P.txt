Great film for everybody
I TOOK A 14 yr old boy and 2 8 year girls. All of us enjoyed this film and were still talking about 2 days later. A good tale about teens and pain that seems so deep that one will be destroyed. But a plan is put into action that is exciting to watch to do something bigger than themselves. Enjoyed all the young actors. I felt the plot of the movie was disclosed quickly. Getting the guys for the last night together was funny to watch. Some were able to make a clean get away while others struggled with telling their parents. The turns the guys took on the bikes to follow the map made us laugh. As did the encounter on their find. Good movie.
