Maybe I am a curmudgeon...
But I can't believe the overall rating of 7,0. Although beautifully filmed and with a great soundtrack, I found it very boring, dull, and dreadful. It was like seeing ''Doctor Zhivago'' after 10 hours of stock fottage of the Russian revolution was added. The opening credits lasted 10 minutes while they could have lasted only 5 minutes. Yet many films are very long but still entertaining and engaging to watch (like ''The Longest Day'', ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', ''The Young Lions''), but this should have lasted at least two hours. I felt asleep the first time I watched it, and the second time I left it after 2 hours! And when I leave a movie even after the second viewing it's a bad sign. Many scenes (like the parade scene) seemed to last an eternity, and the acting was very wooden.

Now don't assume I don't like old American movies. I liked and loved many of them, just not this one.
