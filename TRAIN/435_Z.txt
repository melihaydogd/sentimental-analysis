Disappointed
Such a great subject but the finds were not given hardly any time....and what about the Famous Sutton Hoo helmet...? Not a mention. Ok it focused on relationships with the dig as a backdrop....but still . Fiennes is badly miscast in my opinion...hard to believe in him as a ruddy yokel...he has far too much intelligence behind his eyes...would have been a good role for Sean Bean. Anyway, lost interest the last half hour...one to forget.
