What is people's problem with this one?
Overall it's an ok movie. Not the best, not the worst and waaaaay better than suicide squad. It feels like people are hating on this movie just because the main cast is female. There are hundreds of movies just like this with a male cast that people love e.g the Fast and Furious franchise, Olympus has fallen, Taken series etc.

Just enjoy the movie or not for what it is, but don't hate it because it's a female cast.
