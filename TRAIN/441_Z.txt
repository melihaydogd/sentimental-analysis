Run Barry Run
The show was cool at the beginning Harry Caitlin and Cisco carried the show. meanwhile the relation between Barry and Iris destroyed it. Iris is just selfish stupid girl and Barry felt more of an idiot than a Hero. and Tom Cavanagh - Harry- was great being the maestro. to make Iris lead the flash team was just nail in the coffin. I I literally felt my IQ EQ dropping. I watched the 4th and 5th seasons like flash watched tv shows he missed after coming back from speed force.
