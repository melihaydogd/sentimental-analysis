Do not bother this is not a good film.
This film was on TV so I watched it. The film was incredibly predictable, not much of a mystery, and the plot or 'surprise' has been done many other times in other films. Even with Antonio Banderas and comedian Dennis Miller the film cannot be saved, and I was just watching it hoping it would get better while cleaning and to wait for the next film to come on the channel, only the film never got better and was full of tiresome cliches and completely predictable scenes.
