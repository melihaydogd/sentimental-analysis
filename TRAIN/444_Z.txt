Dated ambition
It's very hard to assess 'Peeping Tom' today, over 40 years after it's release.  This is because it is fundamentally a very modern film but one made without modern skills.  A serial killer movie made when these were (mercifully) less fashionable than now, it deals with its subject with less gore, and more sensitivity, than most of its modern counterparts.  The use of hand-held camera shots (albeit with explicit narrative justification) is similarly modern, while the central character's voyeurism brings to mind Soderbergh's debut, 'sex, lies and videotape'.  But the sets are poor, the music ugly, the killer's motivation unconvincing (though in this respect, few modern counterparts do better); while the acting is completely wooden, especially from Anna Massey as the young woman attracted (apropos of nothing) to the weird guy living upstairs.  The portrait of the wider social fabric also seems clumsy and quite unrecognisable to a contemporary eye, although from this juncture, it's hard to tell to whether to conclude that the world has changed, or merely our skill in portraying it.<br/
