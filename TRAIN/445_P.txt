The Father Review
Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance, one of the best in his career, is hard to decide who deserve more the best actor between him and Chadwick Boseman, i know is controversial, but i would vote for Hopkins.Olivia Colman also gives a great performance, showing all the sadness a person would feel in this situation, but Hopkins is the one who elevated the whole material.The ending scene is very emotional and sad, showing once again how amazing is Hopkins performance, when he cries asking for his mother who is obviously dead a long time ago, this just shows even deeper how much he's lost in the time of his own life, the scene also make us see that a person in his condition can feel like a helpless kid who lived a entire life and now is completely lost and confused, sometimes not even capable to remember who he actually is.
