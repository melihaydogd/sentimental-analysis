As subtle as a sledgehammer.
Steven Spielberg is a Hack! Hack rhymes with sack! Sacks hold potoatoes! Potatoes rhymes with tomatoes(more or less)!There haven't been enough tomatoes produced in the history of mankind to throw at the screen to adequately express my disgust with this shallow, schlocky, melodramatic piece of Oscar bait.I can't believe Jewish groups, particularly Holocaust survivors and their families, weren't up in arms after viewing this film. It's an insult to all victims of all genocides.It's like a 'gritty' Disney version of WW2 and its horrors, designed to 'school' 10 year olds.8.9/10? Whaaaaaaat????? 5/10.....at best! (As always, rated 1 star for balance)WOW!! Just.....WOW!!!
