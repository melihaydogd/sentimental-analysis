Could have been a good film without Diane Lane
Diane Lane can act -- just not in this film.  She took what could have been a great woman's role and reduced it to a character with three facial expressions, none of them believable.The best actress in the movie was Sandra Oh -- she was completely believable as Patti, while poor Diane LOOKED like she was acting.  If you haven't seen this film, save your money.
