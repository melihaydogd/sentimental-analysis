DNA v love
It has nice stark images and a cool sound track .  But Reality Check:   The boy is being taken from the two people who have shown they love him, who are his real parents even if not his biological parents, and handed to a someone who is a stranger and clearly has serious issues about relationships of any sort. Sure she sends a sum of money at regular intervals but given that she has made no attempt to contact him for for years it clearly is not about real love. People who like the film talk about how it deals with loss, alienation and an inability to communicate. Fine. But why is it supposed to be a good thing to dump the boy into that nightmare? Just to sacrifice him on the altar of DNA?
