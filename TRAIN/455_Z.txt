Some good performances, but otherwise very boring
This movie just dragged on and on and on, especially in the last half, with the battle scenes. Those scenes were incredibly boring. Roddy McDowell did a very good job as Octavian; unfortunately, through some sort of error, he wasn't Oscar-nominated. His is the best performance in the movie. Rex Harrison and Richard Burton were okay as Caeser and Anthony, respectively, but Elizabeth Taylor gave an incredibly lifeless portrayal of Cleopatra. She was probably up every night with Richard and was too tired in the mornings to put any energy or sex appeal into her performance. And if you expect Taylor and Burton to steam up the screen, you'll be incredibly disappointed. They probably saved that for offscreen. Another lavish, grossly expensive epic that wasn't worth it.
