More focused on science than anything
My feelings mirror much of what nemenemenes said below in his review. In terms of marooned characters, I felt comparatively little for Damon's here than I did for Hanks and Bullock in 'Castaway' and 'Gravity,' or for the astronauts in "Apollo 13." The only explanation I can think of for this is that absolutely no relationships were established for Damon's character prior to the isolation, so you had no point of reference for the type of person he was. You only knew he was smart.

From a technical standpoint, the film is amazing. A huge amount of work and detail went into creating the sets and verbalizing the science (which most lay people would assume was accurate, but amazing even if fabricated), but that seemed to be where all the attention went. Frankly, I was bored with most of the film. One can only listen to someone spouting scientific formulas for so long before nodding off.

The film finally picked up for me in the final act, so to speak, but that wasn't worth the price of the ticket. And I don't think I would have missed anything by watching it in 2d either, as I didn't see a lot of 3d effects.

I actually feel bad for not liking the movie because of the tremendous amount of effort that went into making it, but unless I feel something for the characters in dramas such as this, even if it's negative, I'm generally left feeling disappointed.
