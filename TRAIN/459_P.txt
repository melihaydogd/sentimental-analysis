One of Pixar's best
The Incredibles was one of Pixar's best films. I didn't find it as good as Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up, but it wasn't as bad as Brave, or as pedestrian as Finding Nemo. It is a very long (for US standards) animated feature at 110 minutes and has much more complexity and character development than the usual animated fare made in the US: this is a family film that adults will like nearly as much as the children (though not 100% as much).

It is full of action but nobody appear to die in the film besides the villain: in one scene Mr. Incredible throws a massive metal thing over some guards and they are only disabled. It is a James Bond and superhero spoof, a very well executed one.
