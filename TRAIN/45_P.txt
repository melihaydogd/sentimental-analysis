Best movie of 2007
I was looking forward to this film when the first time I heard about it because I'm a huge Simpsons fan and now it is great to have a movie after about 18 years of TV series. That entire wait was worth it, the film was soooooooooo funny that I had a sore stomach, there wasn't a single scene were I didn't laugh and everyone in the cinema hall were laughing there heads off. The Simpsons Movie was made so well and had an interesting story told in a stylish format. I'm not surprised that it's already on the top IMDb top 250 & I hope it always stays there. I've seen a lot of films of 2007 but The Simpsons Movie is simply the best so far and I don't think there will be a better film in the year. It started off really good with the Itchy & Scratchy show then all of a sudden Homer said "Boring" in the theatre then he said "What's the point wasting money, it's on TV for free". I don't know which the best scene is because I loved every second. My verdict is 20/10 because it was better than I expected and it's truly an unforgettable film. When I left the cinema hall I was constantly thinking about it on my way home. When I arrived I was talking to my family all day about it and the movie made my day. Definitely the kind of film that can be watched again & again. I want to get it on DVD the first day it comes out.
