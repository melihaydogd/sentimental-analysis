Exquisitely sux
Well, great shots, great nudity, great actors, great acting, classic themes it just drags interminably. It is a clear picture of real life but it is not entertaining, not fun, not interesting, does not radiate. It haunts. If I were more familiar with Fellini, I would say Fellini. Everything is a queer presentation, naked people sitting in odd places, doing obscure things at weird times in weird ways. You could take almost any scene and mount it on the wall and contemplate it ad infinitude ( damned auto spell Q ROBOTS make it look like I don't know my Ancient Greek ), the wicked fat guy kicking the ball, miss universe in the water, the other guests in the various venues, the staff, the stories, the Queen. OMG it has a ton of good parts but... I have been there for all of these and it was more interesting, more rewarding, quicker. It is exactly that joke, a camel is a horse made by a committee. We here at norm central want the horse, not the camel.
