One of the best animations
This was a family movie that mini-me chose and it was such a lovely tale! Miguel loves music but due to a past event with his grand-papie music is banned from the family household and they all follow the line of shoemaking. However, it is time for the Day of the Dead festival and he has a way in, a way to meet his family and to get their blessing to play music again and bring joy. I loved meeting Hector, a soul/skeleton who was running out of time as he was being forgotten. Once forgotten you leave the place and disappear. They work together and it is a fun friendship to see blossom. Yet, you know there is a time limit for these two because if Miguel doesn't get back by dawn, well let us just say he has to hurry!

I loved how the Land of the Dead is so vivid, bright and colourful, it is a party place until they move on. It was interesting to learn more about the Mexican celebration and their beliefs, and what this festival represents and means. I have always said I would love to go to the festival and celebrate the lives.

Not going to lie, I cried and so did mini-me, it was such a beautiful story and when you learn the truth behind what caused the ban, well it was so heartbreaking. Bit "dark" for a Pixar film too! It is definitely a cut above the rest of some the newer films and I hardly heard anything about this when it came out. It is a truly heartwarming and magical story, can not recommend this one enough.
