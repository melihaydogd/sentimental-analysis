Good Spiderman movie. Terrible 2-D animation. WAY overrated.
I honestly don't understand the hype. The movie was fine. My kids enjoyed it about as much as I did (I'm 35, they're 6, and we all love superhero movies). I really enjoyed the movie at times, and was bored at other times. The comedy was great and the plot was original/decent. For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I thought we were being shown the 3-D version. I looked around to see if people had the glasses on. The random guy next to me was doing the same, and he left to get glasses for him and his kids. He let me try them to prove to me that the animation was not in 3-D, but rather was just bad animation.Here are my guesses for why the ratings are so high:
1) Only really big fans of Spiderman, comic books, and/or cartoons have seen this movie, so the scores haven't been evened out by the average moviegoer.
2) Many reviewers saw it in 3-D, and the animation looks like it was designed solely for 3-D. If I felt like wasting my money, maybe I would've enjoyed it more.
3) Critics are mostly nerds, and the nerdy critics are the only ones who watched this. They're probably all the same critics who love the CW superhero shows.
4)I don't see how this is higher than a 7.5 on iMDB, and 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.
