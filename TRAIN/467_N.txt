Hated it
There are a handful of movies that many people seemed to like, but I hated. This is near the top of the list of movies I hated. I found it to be nothing more than a long episode of Pok√©mon, with fabricated characters, fabricated scenarios, and no sense of logic, morals, or plot.The animation is pretty good, and some of the creature/characters are visually interesting, but I found the plot, or lack thereof, to be just a progression through disjointed scenes with no story integrity.I purchased it on DVD and watched it with my children who were 5 and 8 at the time. At that age they would watch videos they liked over and over again. But they never wanted to watch spirited away for a second time.
