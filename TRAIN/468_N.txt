V for Very Rubbish Film
A new yawn! With no story and action all they do is go on & on about 5th of November big WOW! I was about to fall asleep after the first half an hour and I wanted to turn it off but I kept on watching it hopefully that the story-line might pick up but it didn't. My attention was on the timer of my DVD Player and I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist or anything would reveal in the last reel but it would end the discomfiture. I can't believe that it is one of the top 250 IMDb movies! It should have been in the bottom 100. The film had nothing but that stupid Guy Fawkes mask if I wanted to see someone wearing a mask I would go to a Halloween party or something. When Evey kissed the mask that is the dumbest thing I ever seen in any movie. James McTeigue must have pulled the script from his bum and was running around his house with it and his wife hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, "You promised me no more rubbish films!" It was a complete load of garbage, junk and crap right from start to end of this 2 hours 10 minutes torture device. Recommend this movie to someone you really hate.
