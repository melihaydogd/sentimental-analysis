Guilty pleasure
I miss the old days. No internet, no social media and no pc bullcrap. "Nobody" is a movie that feels like it came from another time. Just what the Expendables wanted to do but, in my opinion, failed miserably. There is no fan service, no bathing in the glory of former heroes who are way too old for that you-know-what. And no 1980 memorabilia for no reason. This movie just is what it is and the main character does what he has to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Logic? Leave it at the door! Complex plot? Read a book! This movie is just fast paced action and a welcome escape from reality. Just what we need these days.
