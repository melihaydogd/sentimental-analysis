For Immature Minds Only
After wanting to see this for nearly 2 decades I finally got around to watching it...pathetic. First off, I actually did feel excited during the yellow bordered title sequence, I mean the theme music kicked in and I thought I was really in for a something special. My God was I wrong. This film is unwatchable. We have this tin can going around beeping every friggin two seconds. Easily the most annoying thing I've ever had to endure since seeing Julie Andrews (a grown woman btw) actually skipping while singing a song about confidence in the Sound Of Music. Then the dialogue sets in and let me tell you, I've never in my life heard anything so juvenile. Like I cant even revert my brain back far enough to an age where this dialogue would seem even remotely interesting, fantastic, or fun. The whole movie, script, costumes, story is just one tacky, immature mess that absolutely stunned me in its awfulness and I'm being completely serious. Turkey/5 Recommended for fans of Sesame Street, bandwagons, and all things overrated.
