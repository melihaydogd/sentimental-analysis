Humurous and kind, but awkwardly sentimental
The main downside of the movie is that it tries too hard to come across as sentimental according to all the genre recipes, which makes it rather superficial. On top of that, irrespective of a unique and curious marvellous world, it has little to offer in terms of its plot, which is quite predictable, following the same conventional patterns travelling from one cartoon to another.
However, the work still features decent and kind humour. On the whole, it appears ideal for spending a couple of hours with your family, especially with your siblings.
