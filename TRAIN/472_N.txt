I want my 2 hours back!
Who can I sue to get my totally wasted 2 hours it took me to see this crap back? The script is total rubbish from first page to last. The longer the film progressed the more upset I got. There should be some kind of law that prevent stinkers like this to ever make it to the screen. The 16% that rated this movie 10/10 are either kidding or are on some serious drugs. If I knew I'd honestly flush the ticket down the toilet. Rent "Enemy of the state" if you want to see a movie with a similar "Big-Brother" theme, or Matrix if you want to see a guy who's told what to do over the phone. This is the worst movie I have seen in over 5 years.
