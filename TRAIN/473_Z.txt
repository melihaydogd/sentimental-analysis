Great Cinematography, but inaccurate story
I read the book "Into Thin Air" when it came out and loved it. It is one of my favorites. I also like documentaries and docudramas. This film could have been a solid 7 or 8, but sadly is a 4,, at best. This is because it seemed inaccurate and agenda driven- it was as though they could not show a woman in a bad light.

The movie is about two teams who are into the commercial venture of taking climbers to the top of Mt. Everest, People routinely die trying to make the summit, so the fact that some rich people with pseudo expert climbing abilities pay somebody to take them to the top is dangerous, and difficult to respect. Great shots of the mountain, and of Nepal. There is also a compelling story behind the tragedy, i.e. a hideous storm coming in making it difficult, or impossible , to make it down alive. The problem is not so much that the movie is inaccurate , the problem is the liberties seem so agenda driven.

SPOILER- In the movie they don't just soft peddle the fact that socialite Sandy Pittman had to be short roped up by an exhausted Shirpa, they don't mention it AT ALL. The short roping was partially, possibly mainly , responsible for the disaster, since said Shirpa wasted his energy on ONE person. Thats what I got from the book at least, but maybe thats just me. News Flash to film makers- when you mutate the story , people notice. instead they blame it some Texas doctor, who delays them and acts like a jerk. It was as though they were afraid to show a woman in a bad light.
