Overrated and boring
I cant believe how highly this film and Johnny Depp are rated. I thought that Johnnny Depp as a pirate was about as believable as Tom and Jerry. He minced on to the screen looking like a young girl who was blacked up and given a false moustache and beard. His accent although better than Dick van Dykes effort in Mary Poppins was unconvincing, and the character was lame, effeminate and generally rather laughable. This would be great French and Saunders material.In fact Jennifer Saunders would probably be more believable than this!  Action scenes were rather more convincing.   sorry switched off, it was that tedious.
