Served me right for ignoring the red flags
I remember seeing this film way back when it came out, in the 80s ... but all I remembered about it was Sean Young's pseudo 1940s-inspired costumes and hairdo. Instead of thanking the good Lord for blessing us with the capacity to forget things, I recklessly plunged down memory lane.

First mistake: read - and pay any heed to - the sycophantic reviews. The fact that the usual suspects drooled "masterpiece! ... genius! ... brilliant! ..." and most especially, "philosophical," should have instantly prompted me to move on. But ... I chose to ignored those red flags - though they were more numerous than poppies on Armistice Day.

Second mistake ... well, obviously the consequence of making the first. I watched this monumental dud - the "long cut," if you please.

Served me right.

I won't repeat what my fellow 1-star posters said. I'll just mention the biggest cliche in this film: the notion of the future as dark, bleak, polluted (greenies, rejoice!), dirty, full of trash and condemned buildings. And wet. Oh, how it rains in this film! It makes the soggiest Far East rain forest look like the Sahara desert.

Yes, I'm the future will be dark and bleak. But we'll owe it to the pretentiousness of the Hollywood menagerie, not to our effect on the blessed environment, or the caprices of Mother Nature.

Anyway. If you run into friends who urge you to watch this monstrosity, just humor them and say you will. And then get yourself some new friends.
