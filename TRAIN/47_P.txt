REVIEW - AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS

There is a device which sits in the corner of our lounge, kitchen, bedrooms and possibly even in our cars which many people say destroys our interaction with each other because when this device is in use all we do is stare at it, or even just have this device on for the background sound.

The way people may sit for hours on end staring at this device and believing everything it tells them it's as if it was worshipped.

Yes I'm talking about TV.

This film is to be seen to be believed, absolutely loved this film from the slow start and building the tension up until........a valuable lesson learned.

This is in my personal opinion an absolute gem and if memory serves me correctly is loosely based on an episode from Fox Mystery Theatre Season 1 Episode 13 Child's Play / Neuclear War.

So if you are looking for a genuinely scary film because it is all too real then this is one for you.

Rating 9 out of 10
