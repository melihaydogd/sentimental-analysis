Wasted potential
Take an interesting story, somewhat interesting characters, some very interesting characters, pile everything up and mix with mud.

The story could have been told through so many different lenses. Even by giving each person's individual accounts and letting us choose.

But no, all we get is a bland narrative about something that had the potential to be a great movie. So many random cuts. Unnecessary scenes. Even basic continuity issues, like the landslide or the last scene with the e mound untouched except for a little dig. Either that was cheaply produced or poorly directed.

Bonus points for the side story that could have continued as a side story, but takes half of the spotlight.
