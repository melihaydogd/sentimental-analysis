Like one bad acid trip.
In my quest to watch all the films in the IMDb.com top 500 films of all time , i came across number 47 in Spirited Away and after struggling through this animated film i cant help but think it's position is an error. This is one of those horrible Manga type movies that that depicts people with massive eyes and a tiny nose and they looks terrible. The backing animation is good , as is the soundtrack , but the story is mind bendingly bad. The whole movie is like one big acid trip and i really would be weary about showing this to a young child. It's over two hours long and extremely hard to get through. All i can think is that everyone in Japan voted for this film because i really cannot see any appeal in this film and it's a travesty it's anywhere near this list.
