what an excellent film
Excellence! What a great production! All the way with the acting,writing,directing,cinematography,music and editing.All superb. I'm just happy how compalling and how well-thought this movie was. It takes you to a man's story about life and death and how it all goes down when the life turns its back on people and how different people respond to them. The thing that really captivated me was that how people's reactions and choices differed from each other in this movie.It reminded me of all the same things that are happening around me.Wel...I've never been a big Pacino fan but man..how wrong was i! What else to say?! It's just great.Please see it.
