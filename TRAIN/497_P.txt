An old favorite
This is a movie I have loved since I was a kid when it was still pretty new. I must have watched it a million times. I watched it again recently and of course noticed the special effects were that of the 80's but it doesn't matter. This is one of the better fantasy movies there is. Original ideas, and very interesting and vivid landscapes and characters. I would love to see it remade with today's technology, but I'm afraid that someone would mess it up somehow. This movie is magical and I consider it a classic. Of course, I was raised watching it. It's not very well-known but I recommend it for anyone, as long as you have an open mind. Hopefully you enjoy it like I always have.
