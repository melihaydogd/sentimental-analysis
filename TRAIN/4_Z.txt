I thought I was watching a different movie!
This is a silly comedy starring the Monty Python troop, where they play King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, embarking on a journey in search of the Holy Grail while encountering silly obstacles.

At first, I thought I was watching a different movie, but the gag during the opening credits really caught me by surprise and sent me laughing out loud, very eager to know what the movie holds.

The plot starts out slow from the beginning but slowly picks up steam as the movie approaches the middle, from the King and his Knights' Holy Grail search to the comical bloody sword fights and funny witch hunts. There are a smack of slapstick comedy here and there, but it is the dialog and human interaction that will make you chuckle. You also need to suspend reality and let your imagination run wild to enjoy the film.

The special effects, how ever low budget they were, were done pretty well; the cinematography and color were also good; and the acting was OK - a little wooden at times. It was nice to see John Cleese in it - the only actor I recognize in the movie.

Overall, it is a worthy comedy. I've seen funnier things, though. You need to know and appreciate British humor to enjoy this movie.
