Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie
I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.

What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too. Quintessentially, American Beauty is just a wonderful, funny and brilliantly performed and directed film. 10/10 Bethany Cox
