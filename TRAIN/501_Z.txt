A Deadly Extraterrestrial Battle
In Gunnison County, a spacecraft crashes in the woods bringing a powerful hybrid Alien hosted inside the pilot Predator. The local Buddy Benson (Kurt Max Runte) and his son Sam (Liam James) are hunting in the forest and witness the crash, but they are chased and killed by the Alien. Meanwhile another Predator lands on the spot seeking out the Alien and destroying the evidences of their presence on Earth. The dwellers of the town find themselves in the middle of a battlefield between the two deadly extraterrestrial creatures, and the small group of survivors splits the leadership between Sheriff Eddie Morales (John Ortiz) and the bad-boy Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale) that have different opinions about the best means to escape from the beings.

"AVPR: Aliens vs Predator  Requiem" is a forgettable but entertaining and decent movie. The story is predictable, using the usual clichés of the genre and supported by great special effects and make-up, and a dark cinematography. The direction and acting are reasonable and in the end this film is not as bad as indicated in many reviews. My vote is six.
