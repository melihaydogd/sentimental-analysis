Tear and Human Feelings and Emotions
A female alien (Scarlett Johansson) comes to Scotland to replace a deceased alien. She wears her clothes and drives a van through the roads and streets seducing lonely men to process their bodies. Soon the emotionless alien sees her human form in a mirror and she experiences the human emotions and feelings coming to a tragic discovery. "Under the Skin" is an original sci-fi movie with a short story for a feature and developed in a very slow pace. Jonathan Glazer should have made a shorter film with the cut of several unnecessary scenes. My greatest attraction to see "Under the Skin" was certainly Scarlett Johansson and the hype around her nudity. I have no problem to see slow- paced movie but the beginning is quite boring. But when the mystery is disclosed, the viewer understands the plot inclusive what happened on the bed between the alien and the stranger that welcomed her at home and the tear on the face of the deceased alien. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Sob a Pele" ("Under the Skin")
