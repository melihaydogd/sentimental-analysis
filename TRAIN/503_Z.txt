Have to write a review after watching it
REVIEW - RAMBO LAST BLOOD<br/><br/>Ok let&#39;s be real here, how long can an actor draw out a character, Rambo First Blood was released in 1982 so the answer is 37 years, why am I saying this, simple, Sylvester Stalone is now 73 so realistically he can&#39;t do now what he did 37 years ago, age creeps up on us all.<br/><br/>So with this in mind and paying respect to his age is Last Blood actually worth going to see?<br/><br/>Yes and no.<br/><br/>Yes as it finally puts to bed the character John Rambo so if your a true die hard (no alternative actor pun intended) then sure spend your money but as a film.<br/><br/>Yes, honesty it&#39;s nowhere near First Blood, its definitely better than all of the previous sequels but.<br/><br/>No, the story is weak, long winded for such a simple story and the real action is literally the last 15 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Ok Sylvester can&#39;t do what he did 37 years ago but respect to him for trying but this should have been made a long long long time ago.<br/><br/>Rating 6 out of 10
