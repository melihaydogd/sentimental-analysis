avoid if you have any intelligence
I took my 5 year old son to see this and regretted every minute. I kept begging him to leave. Unless you like stupid and predictable humor this movie is not for you. The only thing we enjoyed about the film was the popcorn. I think he also enjoyed Santa Claus and the Reindeers. This film was very lame, I knew when I saw the commercials that it would be awful but I had several people tell me it was hilarious, next time I will definitely think for myself.
