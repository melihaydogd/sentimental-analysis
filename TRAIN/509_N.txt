X-man or X-rated
So the professor, literate, classy, cultured ... uses the F word like Hollywood stars or rap singers. Wolverine... OK, but he used to have a sense of humor and actually be partially human. We enjoyed Wolverine in his first movie... and he was tolerable in the second. But this? I can only wonder if all of the high ratings were submitted by people contemplating suicide. Dark, brooding, ugly, vulgar... Glad we didn't pay to see it. Glad we didn't pay to rent it. Glad we had something else to watch so we didn't ruin our afternoon of popcorn and a movie.
