Not The Grest Modern Day Western Many Claim It To Be, But Poignant At Times And With A Terrific Performance By Hackman
I watched Unforgiven twice many years ago and both times felt that it was only ok. I just didn't feel it was the great modern day Western that many were claiming it was. Curious to watch it again, I recently borrowed a copy from the library and gave it another try. Maybe I would finally be won over and come to appreciate it. Well, I wasn't. It still much as I renembered it. An ok western, maybe even a little better then ok, with a decent story and some very poignant moments. Yet, somehow their is something lacking, that is hard for me to put my finger on. Something that makes it less riveting then you would expect. Maybe it's Eastwoods performance. Just not sure. On the other hand, Hackman is quite good as the brutal sheriff. In fact he steals every scene he's in. My overall estimation of it is, ia good film, worth watching, but not a great film.
