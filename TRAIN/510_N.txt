What a miss!
I would love to know the production history of this one. It feels like it was conceived as a Jonathan-creek or The Prestige-like story where the plot is enriched by real behind-the-curtain knowledge of how magic works, then got handed around until someone with no knowledge of or interest in magic got a hold of it and let their right-brain go wild. Instead of a clever insight into how misdirection and trickery could be used for crime, we just get magic that can do anything and therefore is a very convenient and unsatisfying plot mechanic.

We step entirely outside of reality and rely on CGI to make props appear, even in a supposed stage show. Fortunately you only have to watch the first 20 minutes or so to know that this is not going to satify magic geeks or people who enjoy realistic characters or a coherent plot.
