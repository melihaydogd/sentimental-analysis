surprised.
To be honest I love sci fi and I was happily surprised. I was expecting a bad low budget movie. instead, considering de limitations they had, I got a good cast, ok story, decent special effects. I would compare this movie to the TV show 
Falling Skies form Executive producer Steven Spielberg. I am hoping they make an Australian T.V. show. 
** make you on opinion but I tink you will enjoy!
