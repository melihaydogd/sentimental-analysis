Epic

Yes it's not historically accurate blah blah but it's a damn fine piece of filmmaking. Great script, direction, performances, cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. The casting is spot on. And though I've seen it a number of times now, I still get a knot in my stomach before the battle. THAT says something! Patterson's portrayal of the Dauphin could have so easily have been clownish, but it is tinged with menace and works so well. He chews up every scene he's in. This is very good cinema indeed.
