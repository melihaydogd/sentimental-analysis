Nowhere as good as the cartoon, but still good nevertheless
I was about 12 years old when I first heard about this film, and I did like it. Now, at 21 years old and looking back at it, it's nowhere as good as the cartoon. The film does has its moments, and I did enjoy some parts, but overall, it's just not like the cartoon.

The only good things I did enjoy was the opening titles (very well done), John Debney's music (which I wish was released!), and some scenes involving the inspector's gadgets.

I'd like to end with a movie tip: when doing a film based on a cartoon (or anything for all that matter), don't hire a director that previously made another flop! Eg; David Kellogg, the director of Cool As Ice (starring Vanilla Ice)
