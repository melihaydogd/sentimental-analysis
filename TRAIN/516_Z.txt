Don't be fooled by the great cast; this is very ho-hum to say the least
Jason Statham, Clive Owen, and the legendary Bobby DeNiro, what could possibly go wrong? Plenty it would seem. For starters; this lacks one main ingredient. Action; it had nowhere near enough of it for my liking. It's actually fairly talky and not much out of the ordinary happens, at least it didn't for me. I dig Jason Statham, and he has presence as usual. I also like Cliven Owen and I love Bobby DeNiro, but I'm really questioning DeNiro's role choices as of late. Maybe he needed the money or maybe he saw something in the script that I didn't, but in my opinion it wasn't a wise decision. It also throws in a love interest for Jason Statham in Yvonne Strahovski, but It failed to garner my interest

Final Thoughts: I would advise against watching this one. Nothing really interesting happens, despite a great cast. If you're a fan of all 3's work like I am, I'd check out something else of theirs.
