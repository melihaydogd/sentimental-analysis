A boring kids movie that is overrated
The daughter of the Sultan must get married soon and she won't pick any of the princes her dad is choosing for her. Meanwhile she sneaks out of the palace and falls for a peasant named Aladdin. Not long after that an evil man named Jafar disguised as an elder convinces Aladdin to do him a favor in return for riches. There is a secret dungeon where only a certain person may enter and inside Aladdin is sent to retrieve a lamp, but after getting the lamp he find the old man won't help him out of this cave and he is stuck inside with the lamp. Soon he find this lamp contains a genie who will grant him three wishes. He must now decide what he wants and what he needs to get him out of that cave, in the eyes and heart of princess Jasmine and in the honor of his new friend the genie.

I have never cared much for this film, for Disney in general to be honest, at least not since the early 80's. I think Robin Williams was the only selling point for me, and he is rather annoying here, as he did most of his lines ad-libbed. I found the story to be rather boring as we'd all seen Aladdin in other movie versions throughout the years. Gilbert Gottfried is perhaps the most annoying human being alive and we have to put up with him here as the parrot.

The movie is flawed through and through, I do like the color and production value and the fact they use c.g.i. and 3-d effects along with their standard animation. I hated the stupid songs, I hate corny songs in Disney films and could've appreciated the film had it not been so over the top and kid like. It could have aimed a bit at kids and adults alike and been more likable, but who am I kidding the movie was a huge success, it just isn't my thing...nice attempt, and good for kids I suppose.. 3/10 stars.
