Interesting, but not great
So many people writing negative reviews seem to have missed the very important fact that this is a Science Fiction movie. Anyone who is an actual SF fan (and by this I mean reading SF, not watching what Hollywood pawns off as SF) will very quickly pick up on the clues and should have no problem following the story.Unfortunately, even when you pick up on the clues the story is somewhat lacking. It feels like one of those stories that should have been a novella, but the author needed the money and stretched it into a novel without actually adding anything to the story. A run time of 90 minutes or less would have been more appropriate than the 108 minutes we are presented with.This is a 4-star effort, but I've bumped it up one star to acknowledge the naked ScarJo factor.
