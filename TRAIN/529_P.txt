One of the best movies of 2013
As someone who enjoys trying to figure out what's coming next 'Now You See Me' was incredibly entertaining. Perhaps you'll fare better in terms of whether or not you can guess what's happening but regardless it should be a fun exercise.

Aside from that the performances were all really good. The director had a nice pace in terms of have things progressed and there didn't appear to be any parts of the movie where certain scenes were clearly sped up (a personal pet peeve of mine).

I was able to see a pre-screening for the movie so there could be some bias in my review (free movie helps, right?) but I am planning on going to see it later today so I obviously don't mind paying full price to watch it again. That and I've pretty much told everyone I know that they should see it in the nicest way possible in order to keep expectations reasonable.

Definitely recommend you to go see it because it's a fun movie/experience :-)
