Overhyped and boring
I had such high expectations before watching this movie because of all the hype created around it. With all honesty I think it kept trying too hard making it feel pretentious, and it bored the hell out of me. The pacing is so off and everything seems so stretched. Even though it's an hour and a half long it feels like three. The plot doesn't lead anywhere and humour is missing. No seriously, when I say humour is missing I mean this is the only Disney movie that didn't make me laugh even once. Infact I did not feel any emotions flow through my body at all except annoyance, because whenever it tried to make me feel something I just couldn't stop wishing it would just end already (the movie).
There's a lot of great Disney movies out there, but this is not it.
