Highly recommended
Acting: very good, throughout
Cinematography: also very good
Atmosphere: great, the historical and foreign setting set it apart from the outset, and the horror and fantastic elements were layered in with a skilful hand. Tension with some genuine scares.
Story: great, unique. The war allegory and the cultural oppression all worked very well for me.
Demerits: actually none really, one of my favourites of the yearOverall: highly recommended 9/10
