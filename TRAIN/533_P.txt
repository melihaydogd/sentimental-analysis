A Satisfying Conclusion.
Episode VI, leaves everyone who sees it satisfied, at how the trilogy ended. While perhaps not as good as episode V, the movie does a excellent job at finishing the stories of its central characters and portraying Darth Vader in a more complicated way. This is an good movie and more importantly a superb ending.
