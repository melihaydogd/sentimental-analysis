Fluffy cute

Better than many other movies of similar fare - the fluffy light Hallmark-y kinds. (Even though this is a Netflix Original, it feels like a Hallmark film). A fun premise about a medieval knight who's transported to current times. But it does start to wear thin eventually. Vanessa Hudgens is a good actress though, and the lead actor is cute.
