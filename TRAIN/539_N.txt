What still of Tolkien ? Nothing...
How a wonderful book for children became a movie full of noise and void... Poor Bilbo... I felt sad all the time during this last movie, as bad as its predecessor. Unnecessary characters (why Tauriel, why ?!), ridiculous monsters, absurd scenes (Legolas jumping from crumbling stones to crumbling stones), fake sets, loud and empty music, there is nothing to save this movie. Where is the magic of The Lord of the Ring, where the Middle Earth looked so real ? Where is Tolkien's spirit ? Why Peter Jackson could betrayed so much Bilbo ? I sincerely hope that he will do much better in his future projects ; let's forget this trilogy...
