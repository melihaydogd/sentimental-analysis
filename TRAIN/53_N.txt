WOW - Oversold or What!
When movies get billed as the comedy of the year, the blockbuster everybody is talking about. Well, I tend to walk to the other way and I wish had sticked to that plan before deciding to watch this complete crap.So here's the setup, Husband to be, two buddies and the brides brother get together for an overnight in Vegas.Friend One - School teacher and low-life, rips is class off to pay for Vegas trip. Not a good start.Friend Two - Hen-pecked Doctor (Dentist) lives in permanent denial of his girlfriends infidelity and unhappy relationship.Brides Brother - Dysfunctional family idiot, quite plausible.Groom - A Mother-in-laws wet dream, yawn..........So here we are four different but evidently three close friends and the idiot set off to Vegas in father-in-law to be prized Mercedes-Benz.What happens over the ensuing 24 hours is quite honestly woeful, predictable and not funny - at all.The problem I think is that the three characters that are supposed to carry the film just don't work. There not interesting or funny in any situation they find themselves in, not once - ever.At one point the idiot turns into 'rain-man' and wins big - oh no didn't see that coming....yawn again.Very formulaic, unfunny crap - and Hollywood thinks we need more of this. Be warned, stay away and spend your money more wisely.
