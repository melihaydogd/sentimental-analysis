Harmless and funny
I heard this movie was a hard sell, which is probably why I ended up enjoying it so thoroughly. The movie is far from perfect the talented cast is somewhat misdirected - but it's their talent, along with the hilarious circumstances that unfold throughout the film's neat 90 min running time, which keeps the film moving and the laughter rolling. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston strike a nice contrast as the fated couple united by a hysterical comedy of errors. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as Stiller's pitiful (and only) friend and confidant. And Alec Baldwin steals every scene in which he appears (would love to see him do more comedy).

I am not easily offended by bathroom humor quite the opposite, I think it's funny when pulled off right. Whenever I read viewers complaining about so-called 'gross-out humor' or "toilet bowl comedy", I am genuinely confused. When the hell did we get so uptight? Fart jokes and bedroom humor have comprised some of the funniest scenes ever filmed (Jeff Daniels in "Dumb & Dumber" or "Chris Tucker" in Friday, for example). I'd recommend this harmless and enjoyable movie to my mother (toilet humor, and all!).
