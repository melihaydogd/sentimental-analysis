Craptacular...
Wow. What a horrid movie. I've read the book and from the trailers I was interested and even excited to see the movie. I've come to realize now, after 3 hours of my life are wasted that this book cannot properly be translated to the screen.

Yes, the book was dark, brooding, bloody and sometimes hard to take in, but the movie was unnecessarily brutal. Approximately half-way through, it became apparent that there was no hope for redemption. I gave it 3 stars for the special effects (though they were oddly placed) and one or two scenes with Rorsach, but the rest of the movie was craptacular - especially the laughable attempt at intimacy... if you've seen the movie, you know which one I'm talking about.

I hate being disappointed after trailers made it look so good. Unfortunate that the director got too wrapped up in his own self-importance and forgot to regard people's time.

I know a lot of work went into this, but I'm sorry - it does not belong in the top 250.
