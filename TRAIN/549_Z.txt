Oh Dear
I was unfortunate enough to see this while taking car of someone's children. I had heard all the negative reviews, but even I didn't expect *this*.

If it had been any other animation company, it would have been passable by everyone's standards. But this is *Pixar*, the same folks who brought us The Incredibles, A Bug's life, Monster's Inc., and the heart-felt Up. I still can't believe that the same company made this.

The animation was not like Pixar at all. It was so cartoony and had none of that beautiful realism. Though the first Cars isn't my *favorite* Pixar film, there were loads of moments where I ooohed and ahhed as light hit the cars. BUT THERE WAS NONE OF THAT in this movie.

I also think Pixar didn't realize who their audience was. The first Cars was tremendously popular mostly because of the Nascar fans in the South. And guess what? Those same Nascar fans do not give a fig about some European Grand Prix. And nor do those Nascar folks care about going green. Politics in a Pixar movie? C'mon.

Mater NEVER annoyed me in the first film--in fact, he was one of my favorite parts in the first Cars. And yet he bugged me so much in this movie! Congrats, Pixar. You've taken a well-loved character and put audiences against him. You'd think those "intelligent" spies in the movie would have noticed he wasn't a spy. And that's another thing--spies? Really?

I hate to be so negative, but that's how it is.

Now Brave is a much more anxiously-awaited film, because it will either sink Pixar or redeem them.

You can do better than this, Pixar. We know you can.
