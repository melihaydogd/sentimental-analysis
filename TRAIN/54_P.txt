I liked it
Well this was fun. It's like a cross between an '80s sex comedy and those Disney movies from the '70s where Kurt Russell gained super strength or intelligence from a science experiment gone wrong. It feels like it might be a parody of those movies ("Are you a junkie, son?"), although I keep seeing people say it's a take on Carrie. I assume that's because of the climax, which is clearly spoofing Carrie a little. The movie teams Scott Baio and Willie Aames years before their Charles in Charge glory. Baio plays a nerd who gains the power of telekinesis from a lab accident. Aames is his horny friend who doesn't hesitate to exploit this new power as much as he can. Baio is enjoyable and Aames is a lot of fun, even though his character is kind of scummy at times. The supporting cast is terrific, with older actors like Sue Ane Langdon, Scatman Crothers, Robert Mandan, and the great LaWanda Page providing many of the movie's laughs. Highlights include the Star Trek scene, marijuana Einstein dream, the cheesy montage when Baio gets laid, and the baseball game where Scatman Crothers makes a fat kid eat a booger. All this plus sexy Heather Thomas and some corny sound effects I loved to death because I'm simple like that. It's a fun movie and I really wasn't expecting it to be. Obviously judging by its score here it's not well-loved by most. I guess I can see why but I did like it so I would recommend it to anyone thinking of trying it out, provided you are prepared for it to be a somewhat odd mix of corny and vulgar.
