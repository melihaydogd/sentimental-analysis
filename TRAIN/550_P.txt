A cozy, comforting watch
It's always comforting when you are treated to a consolidation of your experience with lying, cheating, suave, smooth operators and the pain and distress they've caused. You don't feel as much a rare species anymore, because you can go "Hey, that's me! That's my situation!... to details as even the same plaid shirt I wear to threads and (having thought about) packing it up and buy a rundown little country house abroad..." Isn't it nice then that they make movies like this to help you get through on-dragging mourning periods when you can't take too much intense, dramatic, intellectual stuff that make your nerves as tense as the strings on a cello. When you need a lot of hot chocolate, hot water bottles and your cat on your lap, this movie will top it off. Even though not Oscar-material, it's lovely. Enjoy!...
