Good concept!!but failed to maintain the momentum
Yet another movie of pixar with a nice concept but failed to capitalize it...it was surprising that there was not one funny scene in the movie to which i could laugh.It is very disappointing that after a brilliant movie like wall-e with a brilliant concept and perfect execution pixar gave us UP which disappointed me very much...the movie is good enough to watch but this is not what i expect from pixar..this is not anyone expects from pixar!!!overall i am not satisfied with the movie and i don't think it is worth an 8 or a 9.this movie is overrated and i recommend everyone who loves pixar and loves their movies like wall-e,toy story,monsters inc. etc...to avoid this movie!!!
