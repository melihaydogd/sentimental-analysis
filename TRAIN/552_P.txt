Very authentic
This is a nice movie with a very authentic story behind it. Both lives of the genius composer-musician, and his once driver tough-Italian guy, who ended up acting in mafia movies and series from Godfather to Sopranos, together with his son who won 2 Oscars, are very interesting, and the story has its authenticity to stand as its greatest strength. This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human. In the writing since the 80s, it gives 0 fs about the PC hyst eria, and can in fact teach our dear ment ally deficient woke friends what is the true face of disc rimination and how the real life heroes of the 60s, that they would in their stup ididty surely despise, in fact look like.
