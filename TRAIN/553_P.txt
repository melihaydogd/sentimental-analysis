Aged like a good wine
Well as the title says: it did really age awesomely. It's a damn good story, easy and pleasant though it hasn't got a banal nor obvious plot. Also some detail aged well with the obvious change of moral occurred in forty years, so it's not old stuffs. The songs and the dances are good, well connected to the story and they are powerful, God if they're powerful. The feelings aroused by Johnny and Babe are really amplified or highlighted by the music, their dances, their movement, and this make the movie somehow really moving. The act is pretty good, they maybe aren't the best in the world but the give a damn good performance, they are really well directed and the photography is as simple as neat. I can see why this movie is a cult, I've waited way too much to watch it -and I don't know why-, but I'm totally going to watch it again, sooner or later.
