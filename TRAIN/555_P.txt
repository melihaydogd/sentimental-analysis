Riveting-deserved an academy award
The Grifters, An utterly fascinating film about the world of the Smalltime and Bigtime con, is one of the most riveting films out there.It is a character study of 3 human beings(Cussac,Benning and Huston) who live a life many-most-couldn't even begin to comprehend. This is not just a "good" film, it easily passes into greatness. It's a film that you need to watch keeping your eyes firmly on the screen at all time as its very easy to miss key points and you won't want to miss a thing.Trying not to give any spoilers here, what can be said is that this movie is not for the faint of heart, there is violence(including 1 vicious scene of torture that I myself had to look away from) and the film is among the darkest I've seen. This doesn't take away from the film at all-this is a lifestyle where violence is constantly bubbling beneath the surface and many emotions are felt while watching this film as the viewer is drawn into the dark world of the grift-as the events unfold and your emotions go from fascination, horror, and a kind of despair and back again you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen-and that is a good thing because every word uttered, every action taken is pivotal to the film.(MINOR SPOILERS?)Benning's character and her complete contempt of the world particularly men is broadcast in every action she takes(she laughs uncontrollably while having sex-the laugh of contempt for her lover)-Amazing performance that should have resulted in an academy award.The relationship between Cusack and Huston is played so well and the two have so much chemistry that it's both fascinating and repelling.The final scene between them is one of the most shocking I've seen in cinema and will have to be watched VERY carefully to fully understand the final outcome which I myself was a bit confused by.To be drawn into a world like what these three inhabit-a world where everything and everyone touched is nothing but a means to an end-another game- is the true heartbreak of these people and the world they live in. If you haven't seen this film, see it. It's a piece of stunning cinema that will leave you with much to think about.
