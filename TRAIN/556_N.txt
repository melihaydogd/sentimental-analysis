So...
I don&#39;t know where to start. The jokes are...well, not funny at all (unless you&#39;re under 13 with low expectations). Every other line is either &quot;Rick&quot; or &quot;Morty&quot;, which is not only annoying, but shows how lazy the writing is. At the end of the first episode, for about 40seconds Morty was struggling and making noises, and Rick was repeating some lame stuff- and that was supposed to be funny. I can&#39;t stand that easy attempt to relate to some young people who don&#39;t need much in order to be entertained.
