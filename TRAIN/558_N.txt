 No point!
The movie is incredibly well produced and incredibly well filmed. However, there is little point. Yes they want to get a ring somewhere but it does not take such a long time to deal with this matter. Rather the movie would be better off split into a serial aired once a week on TV. There is little character development and no substantial development of plot. Instead there is merely a series of exciting and well filmed adventures.If I had oodles of time to devote to being entertained (such as when I retire one day) then I would maybe have enjoyed this movie more.
