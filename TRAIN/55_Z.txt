OK, but nothing to A&E
This was fun to watch, but where is the sharp wit and irony so prevalent in the novel? The father especially is a great disappointment. His ironic comments from the book are now uttered in a dull, ogre-like way. This Darcy is nothing to Colin Firth. He lacks intelligence and gorgeousness that makes Elizabeth's love for him understandable. In this he just stands there dumbly for the most part and Elizabeth's sudden love for him seems based purely on her favorably impression of the magnificent Pemberly. Knightly is a dynamic Elizabeth, and aside from the irritatingly dingy fringe of hair at the nape of her neck she is lovely. Again, though, she lacks that tireless wit that Jennifer Ehle displays so believably. Jane is by far the best character in this movie; her beauty and little bit of silliness make her endearing and exactly what a Jane should be.
