Not perfect but...
Original in its idea, the way it developed, grew and its representation of satire was just beautiful. So out there, right on the screen, yet not for everyone to understand and this is why perhaps some people were really harsh about it. I don't know if it supposed to be a horror production, perhaps some elements here and there, but mostly, a way to talk to the people. Some listened, some didn't.

Now, as many complained, I too also found the ending to be bland, I mean, after a few left-right twists here and there, out of nowhere, we are prepared for this ultimate climax. A battle like none before, finally someone taking action and not laying down anymore, but lasted only a few levels and then returned to a more platonic experience. I really don't understand how they let it end like so, I think there was room for more and for a really pleasant and satisfying conclusion.

Overall, like many Spanish thrillers, El Hoyo was great, a delight really, not perfect all the way, but hey, I'll take such leftovers anytime and not complain about it. It was different, and it was different good.

Cheers!
