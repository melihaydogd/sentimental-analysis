Better Than Average Cop Film
Although this is great eye candy, and a better than average cop film, it is not a very realistic cop film. Spacey is good, and Jackson is very good. Too good. There is no such cop, and even if there were, they would never get out of this situation alive, much less on top. Getting over on a corrupt cop gang might be an extreme long shot, but getting over on a corrupt cop gang AND Internal Affairs? No way. No how. I give credit to the director for maintaining good pace and suspense, and setting up good shots on film, but the writers are falling a little short in the reality area. Maybe if they had stuck to one or the other (the corrupt gang OR Internal Affairs) they might have made it believable, but not the way it supposedly unfolds on the screen.
