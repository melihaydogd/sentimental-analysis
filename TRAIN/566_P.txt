Oscar winning movies
La La Land is one of my favorite movies, of all times. There is singing, out of this world romance, there is loss, there is sadness and then real life romance. The last scene is haunting and (spoiler alert) the couple does not end up together, which always makes for the best love stories. In the last scene when Ryan Gosling is on the piano, and Emma Stone is watching quietly with her husband, the theater was really pin drop silence. And I was screaming Oscars in my head!!
