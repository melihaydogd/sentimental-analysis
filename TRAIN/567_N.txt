An emotional monotony

The idea and plot has a twist in it but the way movie has been shot - total emotional monotony - just make me want to sleep or remotely slap a character so he/ she wakes up. If this movie wouldn't feature Nicole Kidman I probably would think that roles were played by total talentless random people. Sorry - but movie is a waste of time.
