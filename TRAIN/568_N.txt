Mediocre Would Be Too Generous
Far from Tom Cruise's best – and I am a pretty big Tom Cruise fan. "Oblivion", had a very good beginning – always like good shoot-em-ups, but it really tanked when the plot got all twisted around itself and strangled all logic. And Morgan Freeman – why was he in this anyway? What a pointless and wasted part. If they had worked a little more on his character development – it may have saved the movie. Nahjust kidding – there is no saving this flick. This re-hash of the same old story of the bad guys are really the good guys and the good guys are the bad guys (Total Recall comes to mind), has been done so many times before – it ended up being a bore. The cast was great – but the writing - sheesh? This was something with good possibilities that ended up with a juvenile plot, that unravels to the point where some convoluted ending had be tossed in. Don't get me wrong – it is not all hogwash. If one enjoys action scenes and pretty scenery and you are not really into a storyline, then this is for you. And I can understand where the very young would probably eat this kind of fantasy up with their morning flakes - well yippee for them. Oh and those youngsters may even think something like, "Wow-wee – this is really good Sci-Fi." It isn't. I feel this is mediocre Sci-Fi, with an excellent cast. Whatever they do – I hope they do not choose to re-clone this mess.
