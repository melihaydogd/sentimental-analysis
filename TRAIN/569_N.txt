Cheese-fest
I read the book and if I didn't I wouldn't have known what was going on in this mess of a film. It's all over the place, bouncing from story line to story line with no cohesion. Cringe-worthy acting, actors look nothing like the real guys and the wigs are atrocious. Who is this supposed to appeal to?!?
