The Performance That Beat Jake Gittes, Lenny Bruce and Michael Corleone
Pretty schmaltzy road trip movie that stars Art Carney in an Oscar-winning performance as an old man who's evicted from his apartment and goes off on a late-in-life voyage of self discovery.

Carney is winning and likable, but the film treads too softly and safely for it to be truly engaging. Indeed, I came across this on TCM and spent the first 40 or so minutes wondering if I even wanted to watch the whole thing, only deciding to once so much time had passed that it seemed silly not to.

If you're interested in it for some of the other actors billed in the cast (like Ellen Burstyn), be warned that no one but Carney gets more than some very short cameos (Burstyn herself has maybe five minutes of screen time).

See this movie if you want to see the performance that inexplicably beat Jack Nicholson ("Chinatown"), Dustin Hoffman ("Lenny") and Al Pacino ("The Godfather Part II") to the Oscar. Otherwise, you're not missing all that much.

Grade: B-
