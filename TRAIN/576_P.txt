The antithesis of Eastwood's iconic career is sombre, reflexive, challenging and utterly accomplished.
Eastwood's final western is the antithesis of his iconic career and perhaps even the American western as a genre. 'Unforgiven (1992)' is a sombre and reflexive piece that isn't afraid to be morally complex and presents all its characters, along with their callous acts of violence, with an objective honesty so that the viewer can draw their own conclusions about who is 'right' and whether violence is ever an appropriate response. It's a refreshingly intelligent picture that never spells anything out and is all the more compelling for it, easily becoming one of the most emotionally investing and riveting films in its genre. This is rare, challenging stuff that treats its audience with respect and is accomplished storytelling on many levels. 9/10
