Iconic as you like
This movie is probably on par with the same amount of stuff influenced with the godfather.The main plot is easy enough to follow, however it has deeper, philosophical meanings:
Comments on the harsh realities of war, through the imagery of burning house.
Racism through the idea of a faction, not from there, trying to fit in.
And a coming of age story for our main protagonist, kikuchiyo.The characters are likeable, funny and charismatic which makes any deaths hard to watch and feel meaningful.The plot is set up beautifully. However, it can be slow to a mind numbing pace. This is easily worked around though as you cannot not concentrate as it's in Japanese.It is quite a tough watch as it has challenging ideas, constant taking in of information, being in Japanese, black and white and the alluded to snail pace at times.There is not a lot of humor however when there is, it's dark and incredibly hilarious.The action scenes are more stylistic than substantive: but all in all, it was 1954 so the ability to shoot incredible action scenes wasn't developed to the extent it is now.The movie creates suspense, tension and fear for the impending doom that is yet to come,The art director is brilliant never losing sight of the 16th century ideals. This helps to immerse you in the movie.Acting and score can fall flat at times, especially when the plot slows. This is because of the storytelling being less focused on.Japan's reply to the western genre hits it out of the park all in all.
