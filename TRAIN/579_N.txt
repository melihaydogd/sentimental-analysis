I must have watched a different movie...
... because Internets gave 7.5 stars average to this???

The whole thing is predictable and if you have at least half of a brain you will figure it out within the first half an hour including the ending.

I watched it with my girlfriend who happens to be a special needs teacher, so yeah, she knows her stuff. Me, I just know few things about autism spectrum, but I called bul1$!t on most of it anyway. I can't imagine how hard it was for her to watch. She went out to the kitchen to brew a cup of tea and especially asked me not to pause it for her...

Movie is bad, really bad, I mean you are re-thinking your existence through out and wonder if your time has so little value that it is OK to waste it on Cr4p like this...

Acting was lame, but like fake on purpose lame. Affleck could be excused because he was playing an "autistic" genius, right? But why the rest of them forgot how to act?

I had more fun writing this review than watching this movie :D

Don't watch it. Go out with your dog. Play scrabble. Do few push ups maybe? Anything, but not this...
