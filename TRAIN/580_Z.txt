I really expect more out of marvel
I love Marvel movies. I have watched infinity saga repeatedly. This show is just not to par. I have to say I would never thought I would have to write this review.The show drags on. I do enjoy the chemistry between falcon and Bucky, but it's just bad writing.Marvel if your reading these. We get there are racial things in life today. Please quit shoving it down our throats. We love your movies to escape reality not have it shoved down our throats.
