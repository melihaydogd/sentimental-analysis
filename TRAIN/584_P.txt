A View of the Ark
I have to admit, when I first heard about Paramount's intention to reboot the whole "Noah" epic, I was a bit skeptical. Not because I worried about them monkeying with scriptural accuracy (though that played a part) but because the story of Noah does not lend itself to the traditional Hollywood model. How do you shove a square peg into a round hole without shaving off important Biblical truths? Many have tried, all have failed.

Fortunately, skepticism gave way to relief as the story unfolded. Aronofsky and Handel managed to accomplish the seemingly impossible - an entertaining version of the Noah story. Was creative license taken? Absolutely. Necessarily so.

This is a fun, action-packed, Biblical epic that manages to uphold the important pillars of the Genesis tale. Highly recommended.
