Epic, epic, epic monster ape adventure blockbuster with great action
Beautiful storytelling, amazing cinematography and gorgeously choreographed scenes, a good cast (hey, good acting!), breathtaking shots galore, epic action, and just one magnificent, brilliant adventure. The pinnacle of adventure blockbusters. It's not a masterpiece, but I love it and I think it's a well-made, great film. Gives me an abundance of good memories.

The action is awesome, the Native scenes are intriguing and very terrifying, the music is tense and epic and massive, Kong is wonderful, a complete furry wrecking delight. I love the Kong scenes the most but the build up and the getting together is also magical. I know it's a lengthy film, but to me it fits in well as both a Peter Jackson film, and the way it's filmed and the telling of the story.

A marvellous and fun time to be had. For its score, acting, tone, plot, cinematography, directing, writing, and monsters concept / design I give Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong a worthy 9. Love this film. Minor flaws, could be 20-30 mins shorter but like I said, I have no problem with the runtime. Great action adventure blockbuster monster ape movie.
