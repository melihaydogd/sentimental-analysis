Good acting and story, Tried too hard on Visuals
Honestly I did enjoy the acting and could tell the cast were serious about their roles. The story was solid and convincing. What ruined it for me was the visual effects. Please note I saw this in 3D, so it may be better visually in 2D. The CGI popped out way too much. It is almost as if the effects were a layer hovering over the picture. This issue was notable in the rocket exhaust, storm, and breath vapor. Another problem was the "soap opera effect". The movie, at times, looked like a soap on daytime television. I actually laughed once during a scene where astronauts are supposed to be weightless in a space station; it looked way too fake. Also there were times that it felt as if scenes dragged on a little longer than they should have.
