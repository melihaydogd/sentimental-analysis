Creepy But Very Enjoyable
The NeverEnding Story is a good movie with a great storyline and a lot of fun and imaginative characters.I find this movie very creepy at times for a family film,as a child it really creeped me out,and watching it today I still think it's very strange at times,most children will probably enjoy it but I think that protective parents should definitely watch this movie on their own before letting their kids watch it.The movie is a lot of fun and I love all the colorful animation and the characters,especially Falkor,I always wanted one of them when I was a child and I still think it would be awesome to have one today.It is a good family movie with a nice fairytale theme,but it can get creepy at times,especially towards the end,but if your children aren't very sensitive then its a movie for the whole family to enjoy.
