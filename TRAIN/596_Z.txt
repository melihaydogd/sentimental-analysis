Worst Tarantino Movie
I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, but I have to admit that this is his worst movie, a waste of a brilliant cast, for a movie without purpose. The typical Tarantino ending was meaningless in this movie, it looks like we're watching two different styles, one that happens throughout the whole movie, and one in the final scene. Very boring movie. The usual phenomenon of "high scoring film just because the director is reputable", I realize that it should make people feel intellectual by always giving good marks to well-known filmmakers, but it really misleads those who are guided by IMDB scores. If this movie were from a lesser known director the IMDB score would probably be 5/6.
