Chilling
This film is a masterpiece in psychological thrillers. The character of Norman Bates is portrayed perfectly and as the audience we always feel the tension of the protagonists. The directing is very careful with every shot having a meaning. This is the film I watched the most for my university studies and it gave me plenty to write about!
