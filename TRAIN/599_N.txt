The Academy Hits A New Low To End The Century
What a great example of how low Hollywood had sunk by the end of the 20th century!

Hollywood and national film critics particularly love dysfunctional families so I can see why "Little Miss Sunshine" is being lauded at the time I am writing this.

"American Beauty" is such a sleazy film with unlivable characters I have yet to discover an acquaintance who liked this film. Apparently most of the fan club belongs to critics and the Motion Picture Academy which, unbelievably, gave this movie an Oscar for "Picture of the Year."

Everyone in the film is a low-life, profane and perverted except - of course - the two gay guys who are wonderful people. They always are in the movies and television.

The main character in this film, the father in the suburban family portrait, is in love with a high school girl. His wife is a nutcase who also has an affair. Their daughter is a punk who has sex with the new neighbor. Her best friend is the foul-mouthed girl who seduces the father, etc. etc., on and on and on. There are tons of f-words and nobody with the least bit of morals or ethics.

The first minutes of the movie show Kevin Spacey (that aforementioned father) masturbating in the shower. Well, I guess that sort of sets the tone for this film. For this piece of crap to win the Academy's "Best Picture" speaks volumes.
