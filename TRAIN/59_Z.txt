A muddled movie that could have been so much more.
There should be so much to like about this movie, and how the director managed to create the incoherent mess it became is a mystery. It is disjointed and wandering. The first 20 minutes are interesting, in the mountains etc, then snap! New location with no apparent connection, which immediately disconnects you from the film. Then it starts to build into an interesting urban myth/bogeyman movie. Then snap! Changes its mind to an earth ending Lovecraftian plot. The plot could have made sense if told with some sort of flow, but it became so disjointed, by the end I really didn't care.
