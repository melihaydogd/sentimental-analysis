Could Have Been So Much Better....
As if the true story wasn't good enough they have to drag it out with a sub plot about an archeologist who is obviously gay and his poor, sex starved wife.

So much of interest here..... The dig, the war, the three real people and they waste so much time on trivial characters.

Could have been so much better.
