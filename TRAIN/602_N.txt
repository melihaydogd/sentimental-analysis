Planet of the absurd
I remember first seeing "Planet of the Apes" when I was young and how it shocked me at the end with the Statue of Liberty scene. That was the first time I ever remember feeling depressed. Well, I got over that and became a big fan of the series. But after all these years and looking back and re-watching the films, it becomes a lot more clear that these films got worse after "Beneath the Planet of the Apes".   Anyway, the first film has some great shock value but got too "preachy" with dialogue regarding one political issue after another. Charlton Heston began with this film a long line of career mistakes.
