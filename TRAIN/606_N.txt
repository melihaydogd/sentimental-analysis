It's more fun reading the 1 star reviews
I thought this movie was supposed to be a mystery comedy. The only mystery was why it was made and the only comedy was Daniel Craig's unnecessary half hearted attempt at a southern accent. Having a plot in which not a single character has any resemblance to an actual human being is not funny - it's just stupid and boring. The horrible dim yellow green lighting and art direction throughout hurt my eyes. And one last thing not mentioned by any reviewers who either favoured or like me hated this waste of electrons - the accompanying score was the most unimaginative generic movie score I've ever heard.
