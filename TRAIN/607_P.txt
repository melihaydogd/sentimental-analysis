MASTERPIECE!
Damien Chazelle is a real artist who positively surprised me with the use of colour. The director didn't fail to bring another beautiful work onto the screens and the movie stayed in my memory. Even for non musical fanatics, this is a must-see which deserved all the Oscars that it received. The film portrayed all emotions fantastically and conveyed the raw, real emotions through the use of different hues and absolutely amazing lighting techniques. One of the things I noticed was the ballet of the camera and its swift movement which the director demonstrated to us before in whiplash, but what I really want to say is Chazelle is a real artist.
