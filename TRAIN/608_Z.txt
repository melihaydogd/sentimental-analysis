$5.92 & 2 hours wasted
Got the Blue ray and DVD for $5.92 including postage. Then lost 2 hours trying to watch it. It's not West Side Story or 7 Brides for 7 Brothers nor any Shirley Temple song and dance. Kept thinking "Springtime for Hitler" would be more enjoyable. After all the hype, no wonder the media has lost credibility.
