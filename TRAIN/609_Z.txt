Eh-up fella
A serial killer is hanged in London and his body is seemingly stolen. In Bradford (of all places!) a woman is murdered and her husband is thrown in jail, accused of the murder even though he was blacked out due to the drink. Another corpse is found nearby, so has the killer returned from the grave, and brought his strangling gloves with him?

We'll find out eventually, but before that the film kind of descends into Emmerdale Farm: The Giallo territory as we are introduced to a lot of characters and a lot of drama, starting with Henry (Tony Kendall), who is knocking boots with the daughter of the rich giant mansion owner who is conducting experiments with disgraced scientist Finney, who in turn is in love with the rich guy's daughter. Meanwhile, the hired help are doing just as badly as groundskeeper Luciano Pigozzi and his wife are ripping off the old guy, but the wife is having it off with the butler. Yeesh.

Of course, Henry gets caught lurking around the grounds of the mansion so he's the one that gets the blame for the killings, but who really is the killer? Is it you? The film starts off with a nice mystery, lags a bit, then picks up a bit at the end with a lot of the cast being killed in quite a short time. Not that there's any gore or anything you'd expect from a giallo made ten years later, mind.

One reason to watch the film is to find out the killer's motive for doing what they did, because it's hilarious and brain damaging at the same time. I guess you could say that this is the best giallo ever to be set in Bradford!
