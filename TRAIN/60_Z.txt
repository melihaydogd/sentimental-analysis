Interesting story bad karate

I remember watching this movie years ago and cringing everytime Daniel practiced his moves. Karate is supposed to graceful but Macchio's movements are more like drowning turkey than graceful Crane. And, he gets to beat a black belt after a couple of months?! The story was obviously not written by an Asian. Why is it Daniel-San but not Miyagi-San? Too much reliance on stereotypes.

Cobra Kai series is more realistic perhaps because they have the time to flesh out the characters.
