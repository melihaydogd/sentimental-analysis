watched just the trailer
Hypnosis is what got me into even looking at this. it's a scientific phenomenon that's completely misunderstood even within the science community... and movies don't help. in the trailer it's clear that this movie is just keeping the status quo of complete ignorance from the media and movies. i didn't want to get into specifics, because i really enjoy to know them while producers don't, so they can't easily fool me, but i'll do it anyway: knocking someone unconscious by hitting on the head is widely known to be completely wrong. cheers!
