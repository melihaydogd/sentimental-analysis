Quite a dreadful film.
With all the comic based films to have hit the big screen over the last few years,this film is one of those films that does not stand up against some really good films. It is very fragmented and leaves you asking to many questions.I am unable to say what these questions are as they break the spoiler rule so i have to leave it at that. The acting is nothing short of embarrassing.I am a big fan of Natalie Portman but this is not a film she should have got involved in. The action scenes are nothing special but if you want to see a big clock exploded then your in for a treat. I am sorry but this film is a lame duck and a waste of money.The only good thing about wasting my money to see this is i don't need to worry about it when it comes out on DVD.
