Amazing Retro Movie
Rating 9.5/10
This movie takes back you to late 60s retro. Wonderful cinematograpy and storyline to give new experience from different era's to audience. Superb acting performance to all the characters expecially Leonardo diCaprio a.k.a Rick Dalton and Brad Pitt a.k.a Cliff Booth. I was really amazed by the acting of Leo, he deserves the oscar for this role. Worth to watch.
