DonÂ´t Waste Your Time Watching This Flick
What can be written about the awful "Zombies"? The film is so bad that challenges the aspirant writer to find anything reasonable to be said. The screenplay is terrible and seems to be the sequel of another movie, beginning with two men in a cell during a zombie apocalypse. The one-dimension characters have no development and the situations are odd without any explanation. The direction and the acting are also not good and there are many flaws. But the worst is the conclusion, with the fate of the gorgeous Bena and what Luke learns from Sommers. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): Not Available
