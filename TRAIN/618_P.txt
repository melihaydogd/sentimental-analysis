One Hell of a High Octane Shoot'em Up!!!
You know the star of a movie has a stake in the production when he is listed as one of the producers. Gerard Butler served as one of four producers on the slam-bang, high-octane, "Die Hard" in the White House thriller "Olympus Has Fallen," with Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Aaron Eckhart, Dylan McDermott, and Rick Yune. "Training Day" director Antoine Fuqua and freshman scenarists Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt assemble the clich√©s as efficiently as the corpses pile up in this edge-of-the-seat nail-biter where nary a second of its two-hour running time is squandered. Squeamish moviegoers should shun this invigorating melodrama since our hero shows the villains about as much mercy as they do the scores of innocent bystanders that die from the hundreds of bullets and explosives that rock this R-rated actioneer. This is the kind of contagious movie where the audience spends more time staring at the screen than their illuminated cell phone menus. Surprisingly, most of the White House scenes were lensed on location in Louisiana rather than in the nation's capital. We will have to bide our time until late June when "Independence Day" helmer Roland Emmerich's similarly themed saga "White House Down," co-starring Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum, appears to know how which of these white-knuckled, geopolitical, hostage epic comes out on top. Meanwhile, "Olympus Has Fallen" qualifies as Gerard Butler's best film since his earlier hits "Law Abiding Citizen" (2009), "Gamer" (2009), "RocknRolla" (2007) and "300" (2006).
