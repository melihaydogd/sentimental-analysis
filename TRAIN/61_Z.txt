Genuine originality let down by poor execution
Wyrmwood is a Aussie take on the popular apocalypse, Zombie genre. It's a very down to earth production, that incorporates a lot of very Australian cultural elements. Mateship (Australian for friendship), plain talking, a love of beer, fast customized vehicles and the handyman, "can do" attitude, are frequently employed in this film. The zombie action is reasonable and the story line does include some genuine originality. Wyrmwood is, however, somewhat let down by failed attempts at humour, stunted character development and no real direction, in terms of where the story is supposed to lead us. The end result, is a rather disjointed, lifeless film (no pun intended), that leaves you feeling it should have delivered more.Five out of ten from me.
