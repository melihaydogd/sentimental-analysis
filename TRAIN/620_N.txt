A nice nap.
Being from Suffolk I thought this would be an interesting story about Sutton Hoo. I love long, slow films (There Will Be Blood for example) but The Dig just didn't have enough content to make it worth the stay. In 2 hours they dig a mound, find treasure (we get a glimpse of a couple of golden unidentified objects) and give it to the museum. That's it. I suppose the pathetically weak romantic subplot involving two minor characters was an attempt to add momentum. The other main draw was apparently the dialect coach who helped Fiennes. Great. If you want scenery, go for a drive. If you want to know anything about Sutton Hoo, visit Wikipedia. If you want romance, watch Bridges of Maddison Country (if you must). Otherwise, you'll learn nothing and experience little, but hopefully have a nice nap with The Dig. Even the title is dull.
