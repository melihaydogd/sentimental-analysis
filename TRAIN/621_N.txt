give me a break!
I can't believe this movie gets such high ratings. I just wasted 1.5 hours of my life. I decided to see it because everyone was so high about it... I had such high expectations as a result, of course. Oh man, there is nothing more in the whole movie than in the trailers. And to me the trailer was no fun, either... So you can tell if you are with me at this point.It started really slow and I was waiting for something to happen.. nope nothing... At some point I expected a twist. nope... The tiger, the baby, the tooth, the bed, everything is just so forced. It was like when Conan o'Brien creates absurd situations and take a shot of that moment in his show. Conan's creations are waaaay funny though... I have to apologize from Conan for comparing this movie to his absurd shots since he does them for what they are. But these guys in hangover is trying to sell a real funny story, but I don't buy it. not a bit, sorry.All those screams, cursing, unnecessary naked people and stupidness got me stressed! I didn't enjoy it, but go ahead and watch. I may be the only person who is telling you that it's not good. just... whatever...
