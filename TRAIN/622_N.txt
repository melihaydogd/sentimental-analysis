Top 10 Worst Movies I Have Ever Watched!
Wow, so before I watch any movie I always come to this site. If a movie get anything higher than a 7.3 I usually get excited. Seeing as how The Crow has a 7.5 I thought I would watch it. Little did I come to find that this movie wouldn't even get a 1/10 on my scale.

What a horrible film. The acting was horrible and the story line was just bad. Brandon Lee was not a good actor and the supporting cast was extremely bad as well. The flow of the movie was awful as well leaving you hanging more than once.

Maybe I'm being to hard on this film because it was made in 1993 and most movies back then were filmed the same way, but I literally fast forwarded to the end of the movie because I couldn't take it any longer.

If they were to remake this film today, I believe it could be much better, but for the one I saw, it sucked!
