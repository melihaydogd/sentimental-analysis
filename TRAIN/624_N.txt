The Worst X-Men Movie Thus Far. Very Disappointing.
My wife and I rented a bunch of movies this weekend, and had a lazy weekend of watching various movies we thought would be interesting. Every movie we watched, we enjoyed thoroughly, except for this one. I'm not sure if it was the black and white colors of the movie, the crappy dialog, or the lack of action usually attributed with X-Men movies, or a mixture of all three, but we thought this one sucked on ice. We were very disappointed in this one, and we regretted renting it. It just lacks the appeal and the gusto that previous X-Men movies had. If you are a die hard X-Men fan, and you never miss a single one, then I guess you'll watch it anyway, but for you all who are just the casual watcher, then prepare to be let down by this one. I personally would say just save your money and don't bother with this one, but that's for you all to decide. As for my wife and I, we thought it was awful, and wish we could get our money back. So watch at your own risk, but don't say we didn't warn you. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because they won't let you give less than a one, it's that bad of a movie.
