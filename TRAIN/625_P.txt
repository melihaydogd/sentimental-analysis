Not a comic book fan, but...
I am a fan of this movie. Finally a movie based on a comic book that tells a real story. This was made for adults who want some cohesion and not the mid-stream existence of oddball characters. Superman left me wondering why he would care about the inferior humans at all. When I saw the first Batman I asked myself if Tim Burton would forever turn real life into cartoons. I think his work thus far has answered that one. The rest of the Batman series made me embarrassed for those actors who were enticed by the dollar signs and actually put themselves out there for all to laugh at. This movie stands on it's own apart from it's DC history. To semi-paraphrase a mediocre actress, "I liked it, I really, really liked it."
