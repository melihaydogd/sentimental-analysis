All of You are Just Sick!!!!!
I just read a number of user reviews, and all I have to say is that "You're all sick!!!" 

This lamebrained, terribly scripted, terribly constructed, terribly acted movie is your "Favorite Movie of All Time?"

This is the movie that made me avoid "Ghost" for over a year (definitely a mistake), because after seeing this, I incorrectly assumed that anything with Patrick Swayze in it was just going to be BAD.

The story's been told before (repeatedly, I might add). Even if the story hadn't been told before, every aspect of the movie is completely predictable. Most of the dialogue is more laughable than most spoofs of "Star Trek" (at least when those people are spoofing Shatner as Kirk, they're "trying" to be funny). And the acting--ugh, even if the dialogue wasn't so bad, most of the principals are so wooden you could use them as surfboards.

The dancing scenes--okay, they were pretty good. But unless you're Kelly, Astaire, or Rogers, dance scenes do not a good movie make.

I can see people being entertained by this movie. I really can (just not me). But to call it your favorite movie of all time? AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!
