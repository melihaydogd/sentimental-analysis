Absolutely loved it!!!
I was taken aback by all of the negative reviews of this movie, but have been eagerly anticipating its release, and I was certainly not disappointed. I could see how those who are not familiar with the stage play may critique the lack of a plot, but I actually felt that the movie was much improved in this area. I found myself understanding and seeing underlying themes in a way never fully realized in the stage version. I loved the new song by Taylor Swift and the role that Victoria played in the narrative as a whole. The casting was almost spot on, and I found myself brought to tears at the emotional climax. Of particular note, the fantastic performances by Judy Dench, Francesca Hayward, Robert Fairchild, Laurie Davidson, and Jennifer Hudson really stood out to me. The characters felt as if they had so much more depth, particularly the dramatically different portrayal of Mr. Mistoffolees. The choreography and staging were beautiful. I cannot wait to go back to the theatre to see this again and will definitely be adding this to my DVD collection.
