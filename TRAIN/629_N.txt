Absolutely pathetic!
Well, how do I start? I really had a lot of expectations on this film, but unfortunately, I've been absolutely disappointed. I must admit, though, the first 5 minutes are promising, lol. As soon the 4 horsemen meet in the the "boss" flat, (let's call him like that), the movie starts it's non-stop-ravine-fall. The film has everything I hate on a film: a childish story, a hardly credible teenage storyline, a lack of suspense in the development of the plot, and a very predictable ending, which is absolutely embarrassing to the viewer. However, there is something you can save of this firing: the outstanding performances of Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Caine, even though they're not, by far, worth of swallowing this horrible sleeping pill.
