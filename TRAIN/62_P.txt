ONLY OPENING SPOILER!

When La La Land opened with a clich√© of people singing on the street I couldn't help but think of Bollywood and how I can't help to cringe a bit.

But La La Land made me forget this very fast. It's very hard to describe. You find yourself rooting for both main actors and their success. Not only because they are such likeable characters but because you're never sure you can predigt whats about to happen.

When I finished La La Land I wanted to rewatch it immidiately. I think I've never had this urge to rewatch a movie that fast again. Many things speak for this. The scenery is unique, likeable characters, engaging plot etc. The biggest reason might be how I wished this was a Videogame with different endings. It's funny because the movie has a message for the viewer how freedom and chasing for your dream are important. It gave me this feeling of freedom that I thought I can rewatch it again and change something in the plot so I get another ending.

So why do I want to change the ending? In terms of sending the message mentioned above the ending is perfect. A very, very strong and meaningful one. It's just that I have a soft spot for likeable characters in movies and want them to have EVERYTHING in a perfect way imaginable.
