Total Rubbish
This has got to be one of the worst action movies that I have ever seen. The lead actors are totally wasted on this rubbish, Samuel L Jackson must be desperate for a paycheck to even think of lowering himself in parts like these. I don't know why the makers of movies these days even bother hiring a scriptwriter, as the entire movie is just one long F**K, or endless variations of the word, they even managed to cram three 'M***********S' into one sentence! It is strictly a by the numbers movie, the head of the agency is a masculine looking woman, the agent assigned to protect Jackson is a woman,the villain has seemingly thousands of henchmen all willing to die at his bidding, there is the van chase through the streets, the motorbike chase through the market,the motorboat chase through the canals....Yawn! If you are 12 years old and like to hear the 'F' word over and over again, or otherwise totally brain dead, then you will love this mess of a movie.
