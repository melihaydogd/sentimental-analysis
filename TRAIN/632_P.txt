Such a Interesting Idea That Leaves You Hungry For More
I really enjoyed this movie particularly at the start. The first chunk is great when the lead and the first 'cell mate' are talking. The dialogue is great and really sharp.

This momentum carries in for most of the movie, how ever It did seem to grid to a holt somewhere in the third act and to be honest it was the tail end of the 3rd act.

It has lots of build up and mystery and come the third act they set it up like they are gonna get some answers and they are gonna make a change and then it's just like flat. You keep waiting for something to happen and then it doesn't. There is a plot twist? At the end but then it still just kinda limps on for another ten minutes till the credits roll.

The allegory is also very in your face but works for the most part. My interpretation is that it is an allegory for societal classes and rich vs poor. But it doesn't make much sense. They are, to me randomly assigned a floor each month so that isn't a class that is just ever changing. One mouth you are the rich and then next you are the poor. I do understand that in it's self is interesting as you never know where you will land so you need to treat everyone well. I guess I wish the actions determined where they landed but maybe that would be a different movie.

I also would have loved to explore the world more. This idea is so Intriguing, why was this facility made, who are the administration, does anyone ever leave alive? I feel like this movie could have delved deeper into the lore of this world and really fleshed it out and coloured it in a bit more.

So like I said I think the majority of this movie is great but there are just some points that kinda knock it down for me but they don't ruin the film so give it a watch
