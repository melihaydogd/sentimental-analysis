This film is very fabricated in its character and story development.
I wasn't planning to see "The Pianist". After hearing about the awards and nominations, I decided to watch it. I don't think that this movie portray the life of "The Pianist" and his compassion for music very well. All I've seen from this film is the brutality of the nazis. Also, I feel that the emotion and relationship between characters in this film are weakly portrayed. It doesn't show a family relationship. The most important element in this film wasn't depicted - the pianist's desire and passion for music.

This film is very fabricated in its character and story development. I think this movie depicted the brutality and cruelty of the Nazis very well. However, when it comes to the connection between characters, story, and emotion, all it showed were montages of ideas, not a fully developed story.
