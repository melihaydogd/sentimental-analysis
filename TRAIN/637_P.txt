WOW

I went into the movie with modest expectations. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I absolutely wasn't expecting this. I was blown away by this movie. It kept me interested from start to finish. Even though the movie contains a lot fewer battle scenes than previously expected, it was still intriguing and made any battle scene that much more rewarding. This could be the movie that helps Netflix win their first academy award for best picture. I highly recommend that anyone with a Netflix account watch this. You won't regret it.
