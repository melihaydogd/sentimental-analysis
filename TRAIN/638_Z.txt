Perception of inception
It has taken me 9 years to get round to watching this and during that time I looked forward more and more to seeing it. Was it worth the wait....NO.

I find it difficult to find anything positive to say, but the premise and idea of the film is interesting. That sadly is all, its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters. A collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie. Mr Nolan should have spent his time focusing on a coherent story and some character development, less time on trying to shoehorn in pointless action.

A bitter dissapointment of a movie.
