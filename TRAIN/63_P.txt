It's magical, carefully crafted and beautifully portrayed!
I loved the movie. It goes at the right pace. Each character is carefully chosen and helps build the story. The theme is unusual, but worthwhile if you are going through any relationship issues.Cinematography is attractive and sets are wonderful. How the situation turns-around after the fallen marriage, could not have been said in a better way!The takeaways for me were "build the nest, the family will come" and "keep the childhood innocence alive"!
