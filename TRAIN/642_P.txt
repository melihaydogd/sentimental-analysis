City of God or City of Evil?
The City of a God is a very ironic name for this movie as well as the city that the film takes place in. When people think of God they picture happiness and well being. In this film however, the City of God is full of thieves and murderers. This movie tells the story of how a group of children grow up with very little parental guidance and gives you a chance to see some of their challenges when they are younger as well as when they are older. The down goes down hill through out the movie and you get the chance to see a boy and his dream to become a photographer come in to play as he uses the power of his photographs to create his own affect on the situation. Personally, I really enjoyed the movie. It was full of action and kept you on your toes multiple times in anticipation for what was to come. What really drew me to this film was that circumstances similar to these have happened around the world through history and for someone looking from the outside in, it really gives you a sense of how lucky you really are. As far as the quality of the film goes, it was many action shots showing the perspective of many different characters. The lighting also brought a lot of character to the movie as well, because a lot of the dirty work was done at night time behind the safely of darkness. I believe the makers of this film did a very good job at depicting many of the details of this movie. From the movement of drugs and movie, to the handling of guns and the brittleness of life, they directors captured all of it very well to the point that you could feel what the characters were feeling Overall I felt that this was a very well directed movie with a lot of very well captured moments. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who interested in historical and action filled movies.
