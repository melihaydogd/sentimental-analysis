I cried like a baby..
I watched the movie long time ago, and I've just rewatched it today. For kids it will be a funny movie with no meaning maybe!! But for an adult, its so true!! You lose your childhood personality you change you feel sad, i mean it literally touches my soul Great movie for both kids and adults.
