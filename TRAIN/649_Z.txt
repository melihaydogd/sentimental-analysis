Cynical with a capital "C"
My wife and I were joking because we rented our daughters (2- and 4-years-old) "Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus" (or something along those lines). We were chuckling over the fact that the film -- which features, purple flying horses, ice skating princesses, baby polar bears, fairies and elves, etc., etc. -- could only be the byproduct of multiple focus groups conducted with girls aged 3 to 5.Then my wife popped in "Under the Tuscan Sun," which features a divorc√©e from the States buying a quaint Tuscan villa where not a shred of anything tasteless can be seen so that she can start her life over. Romance and foregone conclusions abound. Bla, bla, bla...Tell me I'm not the only one who sees the irony here.Academically (acting, writing directing, etc.), this is an average movie, so I'll give it a 5. But it if you love movies -- I mean honestly LOVE them -- this movie is proof that Hollywood hates them.
