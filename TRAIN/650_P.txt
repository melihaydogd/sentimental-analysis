A Beautiful and Lovely Film - Britain at its Best
After a slow and sombre start, this story gradually turned out to be a quite delightful and lovely film.

It seems it is quite a hard film to get hold of, but I do believe that it is now available on DVD.

At first, I started to wonder whether it was a film using "non-actors" or locals from the amateur dramatic society. However, looking at the credits, it seems that the characters were all played by both professional and well-known actors.

I only recognised the actor playing the part of "David King". His name was Edwin Richfield. Although never a big star, his face could be recognised in a variety of films, where he played police inspectors, officers in the Armed Forces and barristers. His most famous role was that of Inspector Mornay in "Interpol Calling", a detective series broadcasted from 1959 to 1960. He played in 33 episodes of this series and was Inspector Duval's (played excellently by Charles Korvin) opposite number in the French Sûreté.

I will make one confession. I missed the uncredited performances of Basil Radford and Michael Gough.

The story was filmed in Pin Mill, a small fishing village in East Anglia. It is ironic that the location played the part of a dispirited community, because Pin Mill has always been quite famous for its venue as a sailing area and was used as a base for Royal Naval Motor Launches during the Second World War. Many Landing Crafts were launched from there during the Normandy Landings. It has also been used for location work on other British films and is mentioned in a few novels, including "Swallows and Amazons".

I will give the film 10 out 10. They should make more films like this to advertise what a lovely country England is.
