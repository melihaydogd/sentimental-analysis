terribly boring
terribly boring, full of clich√©s. i mean come on, just go ahead and kill yourselves! i also dislike the kind of mentality whereby you can ALWAYS present the other side as suffering. like some pervert was harassed by his parents. right. a lot of people, especially in Europe are so soft these days you can even sell something as stupid as "hitler-the-dog-loving-person" kind of rubbish - but the fact they actually go and vote and make it a top 250 movie is simply OUTRAGEOUS!!! and who votes for it anyway? i get an impression there's just too much 'nationally' driven support for stuff like that - is it war movie crowd? get over it, this movie is so much worse than other things about WWII on this list, private Ryan included!
