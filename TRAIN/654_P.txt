Simply Brilliant
This movie has one of Will Smith's best performances with the right emotions and never ruining a moment with inappropriate comedy. The whole film is a good balance of drama, suspense and action, not to mention terror. The film can be heartbreaking at times, to the point I myself was drawn to tears. I can't say much about this movie without spoiling it for those who may have not seen it, but the score by James newton Howard is saddening and one of his best.

The atmosphere is full of a silent tension. Despite it's short length, the film is an escapade that must be seen to be believed. Over all great film and I definitely recommend it.
