My #11 favorite film of all time
What a thrilling joy E.T. was when I was a kid. And what a trilling joy it still is. What an intriguing concept, to make an alien from another planet befriend children from Earth. At first the encounter is extremely tentative then by the end becomes a great friendship.

What an exhilarating score from John Williams. Probably the best composer in film history, this ranks as one of his best. The music dances and flows with the images on the screen with sweeping majesty. It ranges from the foreboding to the thrilling.

In my personal opinion this is Spielberg's best. He said he would never make a sequel to E.T. because it is too close to his heart. I for one applaud such a choice for a gutless industry that pumps out hundreds of sequels, remakes, spin offs...etc. a year.
