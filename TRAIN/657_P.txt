A retelling of a classic with a fresh perspective
Fun, hilarious, and overall entertaining. This modern remake has plenty of material that differentiates itself as its own movie. Because of the gender swap, the film is able to retell this story in its own unique way.The film acknowledges the 1987 version respectfully through some story beats as if to tell the audience that the filmmakers adore the original as well. It is heartwarming, charming, and a hilarious flick for both new audiences and fans of the classic.
