Good surprise
Didn't watch this earlier because i formulated the ideia it was one of those "hollywood nothing new" movies with big stars in it. It just isnt! It's a hell of a good movie with good acting, great characters, great script.
Tom Hardy should had won the oscar for this...
Totally recomend it!!!
