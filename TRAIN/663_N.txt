Junk women's movie with no reality and a lot of Corn
I was expecting at least some nice Tuscan scenery, but even that eluded the makers of this waste of two hours.I can handle 'girl' movies like any guy, so long as there's some interest for a person without their head stuck in the clouds of implausibility and laughable female fantasy with not a single iota of common sense.If you want a movie that is as unrealistic as a kids fairytale then go for it, but don't expect great writing or wonderful scenery. The little amount of scenic photography that appears in this film is brief and unspectacular. The acting is forced, fake and f--ing awful. To think this was based on a book that women flocked to buy? I think that explains a lot about why 'desperate housewives' is so popular.
