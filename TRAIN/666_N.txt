More of Hollywood's Liberal Propaganda!
This film is OK as films go from a plot perspective. However, if you are sick and tired of Hollywood's liberal preaching and fringe idealism you should pass. I'm not sure they (the film makers) could have stuffed more of their idiotic agenda in this film. I was actually laughing during a montage of the ascension of the "evil" Conservative party. They went from a classic Hitler image (complete with red and black cross symbol) of John Hurt campaigning to the masses, to images of oppressed masses, enforced by jackbooted military thugs who target the poor downtrodden homosexuals of the world! Good gravy! I am making a plea here to those in Hollywood -- stick to entertainment, we (the general mass) DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU THINK!!!
