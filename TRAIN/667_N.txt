Seriously
The Driver is a man with a mission, to kill the people responsible for murdering his brother. On his trail is a hit-man looking for a challenge, and a drug addict cop.I am a fan of 'The Rock', I liked 'Welcome to the Jungle' a lot, but his other movies have been all a little off...So when I initially saw this I was quite happy, an old school vengeance movie..with a real action star....But what I watched on screen was a disaster.The film is all over the place, the main story of a man seeking vengeance for what has been done to him, is enough to entertain the average audience, and if done well can entertain every fan...But this film applies a British actor who looks really weak. (I'm British by the way so it's got nothing to do with the accent) The hit-man character is truly annoying and so is the beautiful Maggie Grace, there kissing and ridiculous dialogue as well as background just takes away any realism that the film has. But whats even worse is Billy Bob Thornton, he seems to suck the life out of every scene.The only plus parts were Dwayne Johnson whose acting is seriously put to the test here, and he does a fantastic job. Carla Gugino who plays the lead detective very well, and I would have just been happy to see the both of them in the film. Another let down is the action scenes, or lack of action scenes...No scenes of Rock tearing up his opponents like 'Walking Tall'.Very Bad.
