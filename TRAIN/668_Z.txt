For the amateurs of fresh flesh. Figuratively and literally.
The brilliant Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn has already offered us the sumptuous Drive (2011) as well as interesting movies like Valhalla Rising (2009), Bronson (2008) or Bleeder (1999). In The Neon Demon (2016), Nicolas Winding Refn locks himself in a world dominated with an always ultra-neat and globally irreproachable aesthetics and characters who are deliberately cold and devoid of empathy. After the first 20/30 minutes, we understood the message and the film would have benefited from being a short film. Que nenni! The film languishes and barely conveys emotion, with a few surrealistic and bloody scenes. Thus, the last third of the film is a show as gore as annoying. As a synthesis: visually amazing but desperately boring.
