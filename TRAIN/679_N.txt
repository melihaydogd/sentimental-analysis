A Rancid Portion of Sounds and Images...
If you''ve ever been to a carnival and eaten a bad turkey leg, 2 or 3 hours later would have most certainly found you locked in the bathroom paying the price for having done so, miserably clutching your guts, shaking your head and swearing to never go to another carnival again, or if you did, at the very least, not to ever go near that particular type of food again. Such is the case here. Go to the theater, by all means, do. There are many good choices to see out there. But 'Get Out' is the 'bad turkey leg' here. Undigestable, poisonous, foul-smelling...a heaping plate of malignant racism disguised as something for your senses to savor. No. This particular turkey belongs In the latrine pit.
