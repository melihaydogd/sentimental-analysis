Over-rated and overblown.
Perhaps I'm missing something here but I grew rather bored with "Dog Day Afternoon." I found the film to be overblown nonsense and irritating. Al Pacino made far better films during this decade, like the first two "Godfather" instalments, "Scarecrow" and "Serpico." His character here comes across as being buffoonish and totally ineffectual. I found the setting to be wrong as well. The only redeeming quality about "Dog Day Afternoon," is the cast. The fine character actor Charles Durning is very good as the police officer. There are plenty of 1970s American films that overshadow this one.
