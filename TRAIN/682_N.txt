Really terrible
The title for HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY should be DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT, because there's a monster in the basement and every time someone goes in the basement, they're dead.

HBTC consists mainly of people calling out names. Steve? Bob? Anne? Anne? Bob? Steve? It's UNBELIEVABLY dull.

HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY is one of Luis Fulci's worst films. ZOMBIE, NY RIPPER and THE BEYOND are masterpieces compared to this. CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD was also bad but it did have some interesting moments. Not in HBTC. It's devoid of everything that makes a movie interesting. Skip it.
