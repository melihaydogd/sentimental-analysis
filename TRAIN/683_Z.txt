Just childish humor
Before watching this film, the only Monty Pithon film I knew was "Life of Brian". I really loved that film, and some of my friends told me that "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" was even funnier. May be it was because I had such a great expectations, but the film really disappointed me.

I would't say it's crap, I admit the movie has a few funny jokes. But generally I found it just ridiculous and childish. Senseless jokes without any further objective than ridiculing some Middle Ages myths. And don't misunderstand me, I have nothing against humor that tries to ridicule myths. It's just that I didn't find funny most of the jokes.
