Bad
They're not zombies and there's no Satan or spoiler. The worst part is that this movie is just too long. Nothing that happens in the first half hour matters. I've seen worse and you can't give less than 1 star so this has to get 2. I would love to see the further adventures of Mother, that would be interesting.
