We are back down that Tom Cruise road again...
OK first off every time I see Tom Cuise in connection with anything, even so a movie, I just instantly imagine him saying "I am an OT level 9 and I will ace this thing". The actor is just boring and as featureless and cheesy as a frozen pizza and as cocky as he was back in Top Gun. I'm guessing if Arnold was the choice of great action movies for his accent, overly masculine features and brutality of character then Tom Cruise is like the quirky idiot, like Jim Carry just that he does understand that he is not funny in any way and should just quit showbiz once and for all. As far as the movie goes - don't really want to waste words: classic rivalry, an antihero woman and a love affair, a stock "scary horrible super-alien" with a twist, and the whole movie just wreaked of Groundhog Day and some indiscernible hints of Starship Troopers and Terminator V. And of course one-liners and almost toilet-humor level jokes. If you want to kill braincells and lower your IQ, this movie is right down your alley of boring action movies.

For what it's worth the CG was good, but that's a given with such a budget.
