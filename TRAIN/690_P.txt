'You sold your soul so many times nobody's buying anymore'
Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky, Almost Famous, We Bought a Zoo) has been called an idiosyncratic writer and here he not only writes this at times bizarre script but also directs it. Parts of it work well, other parts bet lost in the transition form the words in a script to the action in the film. And that is most assuredly not because of inadequate actors: the cast is filled with some of the finest actors of the day. But in the end the ideas he places before us - military duty before personal life, greed and corruption in the 'purchase ' of the skies, old flames and new attractions/counter-attractions, environment protection versus technology – are worth of our attention and by film's end it all works out just fine. It is the getting there that is a bumpy road.

The story is so complex with sidebars and secondary themes that keeping a synopsis to a minimum works best: A celebrated military contractor Brian Gilchrist (Bradley Cooper) returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs – Honolulu, Hawaii – and reconnects with a long-ago love Tracy Woodside (Rachel McAdams) while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog Allison Ng (Emma Stone) assigned to him. Toss in Tracy's current secretive and quiet military husband Wood (John Krasnski), Brian's new contractor boss Carson Welch (Bill Murray), the past military buddies of Brian (Danny McBride, and Alec Baldwin) and some complicated Hawaiian figures and the pie is baked.

Bradley Cooper, Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone and John Krasinski are excellent and make the film glow whenever they are on screen. Cameron Crowe deals with a lot of psychological overlay here and while at times it is confusing, it is in retrospect very erudite.

Funny at times, touching at times, and mostly entertaining.
