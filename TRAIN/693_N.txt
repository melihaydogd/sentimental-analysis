A violent cartoon
I was really disappointed with this film. It is sold as a sort of triumph of the human spirit film, but it is more like a typical mafia gangster film transplanted to Brazil and the seventies. I was waiting for the Godfather to come out any minute and say "He takes out a knife, yah take out a gun." Scene after scene is of someone getting killed and the deaths have all the depth and meaning of a pixel creature getting shot in a video game. This film entertains on the most base level and has no depth whatsoever.

I can't say that I cared about anyone in this film, except for maybe Knockout Ned. The main character doesn't really do anything to improve his life. It is more like he just wanders out of the neighborhood. Where is the triumph in that? He also never seems to pass judgement on anyone or anything that happens around him. Its like stuff just happens. This dude died, and then that dude died, and yawn.... Great, he has the moral character of a robot, real inspiring.

I also noticed that its one of those "based on a true story" films, like that is supposed to make us think. "Wow, I just saw a part of life that I never understood before. Its hard to believe that life is so cheap and that no one cares about anything in this neighborhood." Well, I don't buy it. Its just too cartoonish to be real. Maybe the basic story line happened but that is about it.

By the way, my wife walked out on this film. I guess she thought going to the meat packing plant and watching cows being slaughtered would probably be entertainment at the same level. But at least it wouldn't be set to Samba music!
