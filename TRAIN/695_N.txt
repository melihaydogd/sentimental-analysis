You call this a thriller good gracious good heavens?
"North by Northwest" is just a light-hearted,unserious move with lost of illogical scenes in the plot.An advertising man, Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant), is mistaken for a government agent and pursued by spies who want to kill him. Thornhill is framed for murder and forced to elude the police as well as the secret agents.During the sequence of event you see many coincidences and unreasonable actions.One of them is Grant's character being chased by a crop duster. To think of killing a man with a chopper twisting around him above! Grant and leading lady Eva Marie Saint's clambering over the faces of Mount Rushmore in an attempt to evade their enemies but somehow the enemies are bypassed(one of them falls down) the other is shot by the police which arrives at the last minute in such movies that have non-apodictic plots! Another one is Grant's meeting Eva Marie Saint in the train. Have you ever seen a secret agent who involves her emotion in the job she does at least in love-at-first-sight struck way? Well the only thing I find in the movie is a little bit a sense of humor. Nothing more! Just an average light-hearted movie of which plot wanders aimlessly! And that is not enough even to be at the bottom of top 250? You call this a thriller good gracious good heavens!
