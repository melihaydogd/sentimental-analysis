Dumb and boring.
What to say.. a cliche story, badly told, with non believable characters 1/4&quot; deep.  I rented this movie because a friend told me it was the best movie ever, unfortunately it was pretty much the opposite, especially the whole setup. I saw Saturday morning cartoons that were more interesting.
