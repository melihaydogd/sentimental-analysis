Don't fall for this trap!! It is nothing like the past Harry Potter movies and has a terrible terrible plot which is already shown in the trailer...
This is a straight-up trap and waste of special effects.JK Rowing must be too lazy to think up a new good story so she just slapped the Harry Potter theme in a Harry Potter universe and filled it with special effects and no real story. I'm serious a 10 year old could have written this story.The only thing that sells the movie is JK Rowing and a huge special effects budget.You will be disappointing if your movie maturity is older than 15 years old or you have a working thinking brain.I'm a die hard fan of Harry Potter but this was just boring and crap.
