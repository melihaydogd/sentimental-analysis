Greater vanity and presumption than quality
This film is the end of a trilogy that started very well but ended up derailing quickly. Extremely ambitious and very original, it was difficult to keep the flame burning throughout three films. This film, in particular, is the immediate continuation of the action of its predecessor, and suffers from the same problems and flaws, although it is slightly better, in my opinion.

The film continues to look cool and to rely heavily on the style that it created right at the beginning of the film. The action and the strong special, visual and sound effects are still there and continue to make everything look incredible, but it no longer surprises us and it just isn't the same anymore. The same goes for the soundtrack, which no longer has the power I felt in the first two films. The script continues to tell a strange story, but that is still not the problem. The problem is that the film seems to want to bet on everything without actually doing so. And so we have, for example, the Merovingian's reappearance without this bringing any positive additive to the film ie more than a cameo. This is just to give an example of how strange some of the script options were. The film also has a dissonant and uneven rhythm that makes certain parts of the film drag as if they were dying. The actors continue to look good, and I think they seemed to me much more human in this film than in any of its precedents. The problem was some of the dialogues, which just don't make any sense.

I think the directors of the film let themselves be carried away by the success and the recognition and, at a certain moment, they thought they were making a gigantic masterpiece of the cinema, and that this ended up being reflected in the film, giving the feeling that the film wants to be more than it is. And that is always boring. Instead of doing a job that could match the quality of the first film, the directors fell asleep under their own laurels.
