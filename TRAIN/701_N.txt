Lights, Camera, Distraction
When much too wordy for a dead guy narrator William Holden tells us about the dark ominous mansion he's happened upon, the direction and atmosphere doesn't match up. He could be walking up to a drugstore in the middle of a busy intersection and it'd be equally as suspenseful.Perhaps the best thing about the outrageously overrated Sunset Boulevard is it's a monster movie and in that, a terrifyingly creepy Gloria Swanson makes up for a bland and overly glib Holden who, outside the main location, has a flirtatious affair with cute ducky-lipped Nancy Olsen as part of a soapy Hollywood-satire melodrama that simply isn't thrilling enough to be called a thriller. And it's definitely not a Film Noir.If anything, Sunset is a satire on Hollywood BY Hollywood with its built-in gripes not very universal: a lot like another Hollywood satire (considered a classic as well) decades later, also starring William Holden. Both are vastly overrated.
