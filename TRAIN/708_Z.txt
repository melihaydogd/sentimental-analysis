Nice effects with paper thin plots and dialog to match
This is the most disappointing of the three. While number two had its faults nothing compares to the third installment. The plot was paper thin and the dialog was campy. I'm surprise the actors could deliver them with a straight face. The ending was a confused mess. While I don't believe that neat and tidy endings are necessary I do believe in well thoughtout endings. The only thing carried throughout the trilogy was the special effect.

This series started out with such promise but it failed to deliver outside of the first one. It makes me long for the Star Wars series.
