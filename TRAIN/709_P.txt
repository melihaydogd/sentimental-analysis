I love it when a plan comes together! A Simple, short review.
The A-Team is easily one of the best summer movies made (It knows what it is, and what it isn't - It doesn't try to be anything else), and some of the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.

On top of some great action sequences that left people cheering, the crowd also laughed non-stop. Bradly Cooper's comedic timing is excellent!

This one is worth checking out. Bring your friends! They did the show justice, and will introduce a younger generation to a great show. Carnahan put together a great movie, which easily could have gone the way of Starsky & Hutch, or Charlies Angels.

Have fun!
