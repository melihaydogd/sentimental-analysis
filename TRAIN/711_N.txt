long silence, same thing for over 1h
wort movie i ever seen I just don't understand how a good actress like Scarlett Johansson accept this awful scenario this is the only movie where you don't need to understand English to be able to watch it because nobody speak a dame word. You have to wait exactly 94mn to be able to see some action and understand what is really going on and again in a total silence. Really awful movie from it looks like a retarded producer I can't imagine why they needed a star of Johansson's magnitude for this low-budget trash. Nor can I imagine why she took the role. The SPECIES movies covered the storyline more thrillingly and more viscerally. If this is meant to be a pretentious "art-house" film about an alien predating on alienated members of Scottish society, all I can say is it definitely alienated me!
