Batman Begins and continues to bore for over 2 hrs
Won't take too much time from this unbelievably enthusiastic crowd to state all the reasons I found this flic so slow and tedious, but have to state quickly that I found the 3 younger actors to be the most lame and wimpiest of any in the Batman series (even though I thought Val Kilmer was a total farce!). Luckily Katie Holmes got a big diamond from Tom Cruise this a.m. at the Eiffel Tower so her future may not be too dependent upon her acting ability. Christian Bale was definitely not believable as having class and polish in his role of a young millionaire. Also, does anyone else think Cillian Murphy would be a good one to cast in a young Bo Derek role? Just throw a long blonde wig on him and he could pass for what she looked like in the mid 80's. (OK, so he'd need a built-up bra and some longer legs!) Thank goodness for popcorn, Morgan Freeman, Ruttger Hauer and Gary Oldman...at least I didn't fall completely asleep.
