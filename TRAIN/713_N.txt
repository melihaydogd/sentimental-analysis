Waste of time
I found this movie very boring. I will not spoil the movie, however I would say that I would not see this movie again. I found this movie very slow and very boring. I think this movie lacks direction and ending. Within the first couple minutes you easily figure out that Lou is a psycho but other than that, there are no real plot twists. I found the ending very disappointing and lacking closure. There are several good television shows that I would like to recommend if you enjoy the psychotic crime drama, Dexter and Blacklist being two of them. Both shows are very good and are a much better use of your time than this movie.
