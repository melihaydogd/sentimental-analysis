Great scenes mixed in with 2 hrs of put me to sleep cinema
I personally felt this movie was entirely too long. I know thats probably been said to death, but I for one couldn't wait for him to fall and the movie to end. I am a huge fan of epics, if you look on the list of my favorite films more than half are epics. I can set through a 3 hr movie with no problems if its a great movie, but for some reason I couldn't stay interested in this movie. I'll admit there were scenes that were awesome, but everything in between those scenes almost put me to sleep. Peter Jackson can do some amazing things, but he took a good 1 1/2hr movie and made it a sleeper of a 3 hr movie. Jackson can create a scene that can absolutely enthrall you; at the same time though there was so much of this movie that could have been easily edited out. King Kong obviously doesn't have the story that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy has. There just isn't enough entertaining story to make a 3 hr movie out of. It seemed to me that Jackson was under a lot of pressure to make a huge 3 hr plus epic that he couldn't just make the movie how it needed to be made.
