Holy Grail
I always feel like I'm one of the very few not in love with Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I've seen it a few times and just never have the uproarious laughter that everyone else seems to experience. Still, despite not loving it myself, I can certainly recognize that there is clever, pertinent and prescient commentary on the world. It's also impossible to ignore the pop cultural impact it's had. The movie is so quotable that there's a good chance a lot of people quote it without even having seen it and that's just impressive.
