What happened? (down to 5 from 10/10)
All the episodes in Season 1 &amp; 2 were masterpieces, especially when compared to the first few episodes in season 3. <br/><br/>A show like this shouldn&#39;t have any political bias - that&#39;s what made it great. <br/><br/>Now I&#39;m starting to see leftist political bias creeping in there. <br/><br/>Do all great shows have to be hijacked to push agendas once there are enough viewers? <br/><br/>Prior to this, the show had a very well executed comedic yet cynical view on all aspects of modern life intermingled with entertaining scientific and philosophical scenarios involving time travel, multiple dimensions, biological mutations, existentialism, etc. <br/><br/>What happened? The edge is gone. The show has gotten soft and emotional. Jerry gets a divorce . . . really? Diversity is mentioned. Later we see a drunk, emotional Rick. <br/><br/>It&#39;s sad to see political correctness destroy art.
