A little overrated, but still a good movie
I got this movie from my local library. I liked it. It was good. But was it good enough to be one of my favorites? Hell, no. I mean, the scenery, acting, and music is really good and all, but I'm not a big fan of MILITARY films. I am well aware that I am the wrong audience for this movie. This is a film for people who want to get their jollies watching people fighting in Vietnam. Watching people fighting in Vietnam is cool, but it's not The COOLEST S**T EVA. I haven't seen any other Oliver Stone movies, but I'll check some more out to see if any of his other movies are rated just the right amount. Oh, well. "Platoon" may be overrated, but at least it's not as overrated as "Iron Man". :D
