Good Movie but Not My Kind Of Movie
This movie seriously stunk real bad! There was a lot of math and science involved, so much that it kinda makes me feel retarded now. Don't get me wrong I mean I enjoy algebra and arithmetics. But I don't even think mastering in solving word problems will be a benefit. I got an A in Physics 1 but that's only because my professor is too easy. In addition, there were many scenes that are slow or just boring talk. This movie overall felt like 5 hours long, though supposedly in reality it was only 2 1/2 hours. The only parts that seemed of interest to me are the gorgeous shots of Mars. However, I don't recall the red planet ever being that stormy. Hollywood, London, and NYC don't ever make super long dramatic, mathematical movies like this ever again! Keep them less then 2 hours and eliminate or limit the profanity.
