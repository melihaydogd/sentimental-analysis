pure junk
A waste of time, money, and talent. This film is a comic book at its lowest,worst, most obscene level. Ridiculously violent,visually unpleasant,unbearably loud,poorly plotted,and embarrassingly acted. If there has been any movie to come out recently that is worth walking out of, this is it. It's noteworthy for that alone. The one question it did raise, however, is this: is it really possible that with all the creative talent that exists in the industry that makes films,the re-cycling of previous blockbusters is what warrants the resources and energy that were so obviously spent on this? It will make a fortune for its producers and many of its participants but it is not worth the price of a ticket and is truly offensive to adults and destructive to children.
