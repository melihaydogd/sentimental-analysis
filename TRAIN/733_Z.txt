Pretty basic
People complaining about the forced racism bad messages need to recognise what's really wrong with this show.The plot is basic as anything! It's a team up superhero show and unlike stuff like guardians of the galaxy it lacks a bunch in the personality bracket.Stuff like this is the reason people can't take superhero films or TV shows seriously yet, and when they have an interesting concept they end up ruining it with really easy to watch fight scenes, which this show has plenty of.The annoying thing is they can get it right infinity war was amazing, but they hardly try sometimes because you can barely critique them without hearing things like "but it's just a fun kids movie" or "just turn your brain off to it".Please Marvel actually do something with this Captain America bad version that's not just 1 dimensional bad guy, or making him become one of the bad terrorist people (SCARRYYYY!!) before last minute he says "actually I'm a good guy because that's what my dead friend would have wanted and you'll all forgive me for killing a man".
