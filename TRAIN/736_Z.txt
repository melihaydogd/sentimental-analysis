Memorable Retro (No Spoilers)
The dance scenes in this film have always been pretty memorable -- probably the Swayze factor imo. The constant reminder of the social divide between "the guests" and "the help" pushed throughout the film (no spoilers) was a major topic back in the '80s as women were really working hard to break through the glass ceiling both socially and professionally. The film seems to be making a comeback now as the opening film to an DVD double-feature with "The Help".
