No redemption
The film es bleek, no redemption, no story arch. It was so terrible being Yves? I bet there were moment of pure professional glory... but I guess being gay was what was most important thing about hike in his personality. At least that it was portrayed... his sexual life in our face... fashion and milestones 0.5%.
