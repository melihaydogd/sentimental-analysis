Poor Kevin, Poor Me
I was excited to see Kevin Bacon starring in something new, but this is just something old and moldy. I don't understand how movies like this even get made. There is nothing new here, it's just a jumble of scenes that don't mean much in a movie that is suppose to be a horror mystery. Like so many not even up to mediocre films , I kept expecting this to get good and instead it's just a bore. They throw in all this melodrama that adds nothing instead of building suspense and interest. By the climax , if you could call it that, I was nodding off and I figured out the film's secrets early on. The best thing I can say is, Kevin Bacon is still an attractive man , but this was a huge disappointment. Unless you really need to see him, this isn't worth watching. This isn't even as well done as your average low-budget horror film. In 2020 , shadows on the wall, just do not cut it.
