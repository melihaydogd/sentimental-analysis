Quite possibly the worst film I'm ever seen
This is quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen.

The acting (in most places) is often terrible.

The directing/editing is also terrible (far too many half speed shots and poorly executed montages with a lack of coherent shots).

The special FX (the airport bomb scene) were comically bad. And the sound effects for the "fight" scenes were also comical.

I could go on and on. How this is in the top 250 IMDb films is beyond me. Whilst watching we were unsure whether the film was meant to be satirical.

Perhaps the only redeeming factors are the soundtrack and the somewhat interesting moral dilemma raised in the protagonist's 10 minute nonsensical monologue.

Do not bother watching this.
