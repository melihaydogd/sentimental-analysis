An Idiotic Melodrama for Teens, Half-Wits and Teen Half-Wits
Movies keep getting more idiotic and the audiences just get more brain dead by watching them. Anyone over the age of 15 who gave this movie a good review probably still lives with their parents, eats peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch and is still a virgin. This movie is asinine, juvenile and just plain derivative. There are so many films this movie has copied that are SO much better it is almost pointless to watch it. The teenage melodrama that exudes from this stinker is like "The Crow" with bigger acne pimples. If you think this is a 'good' film try watching "Brazil", the director's cut of "Blade Runner" or even "1984" (not great but a masterpiece when compared to this crap). This is not as bad as "Sin City" (my vote for the worst film of 2005) but it has so much sucky teen angst that it will make you want to buy a slurpee and ride a BMX. My verdict: V for Vendetta is total crap with a script that seems to have been written by a grade 9 student with an inferiority complex. Avoid this film if you are older than 15 and you have an IQ above 75.
