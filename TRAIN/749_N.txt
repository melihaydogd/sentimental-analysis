Cheesy ripoff 'sequel' to "Very Bad Things" (1998) gave me a hangover.
It's amazing browsing thru some of these 15 page orgasmic rave reviews to such an unoriginal lackluster film.Very Bad Things: 5 guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party and all hell breaks lose. Cops. Comedy. Suspsense. I think they might have even been driving there from LA.HANGOVER: 4 guys drive from LA to Vegas for a bachelor party and 'all hell breaks lose'. Cops. "Comedy". "Suspense".I was amazed that the opening scene of HANG depicts the story line just before the actual wedding, and then after the short title sequence a caption appears saying "Two days earlier". This had to happen within 4 minutes of the film. VBT (1998) start with a scene just before the wedding ceremony, showing the male actors all stressed out, and then a captions says "A few days earlier", within about 2 minutes. In HANG the male actors are calling in to the wifey just before the wedding all stressed out with their potentially wedding altering circumstances. Not even original there, as the notion of the wedding being called off due to the events leading up to it was already done in VBT.VBT contained some of the best acting of the careers of the many known faces. Hangover contained bad acting from a bunch of nobody's. VBT even contained some gut wrenching special effects, although compared to HANG it didn't need any, whereas HANG was desperate for anything to spice it up in VBT's wake.VBT is a top notch dark comedy, whereas HANG attempts to enter the category and falls smack into its own dark crack.
