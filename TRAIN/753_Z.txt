Nominated for 12 Oscars?
Sorry but this movie is terrible. You get thrown in the movie without any explanation of the story and the characters and during the movie this doesn't improve. What really annoyed me is the fact that the movie was very unrealistic, like a lot of others users write in their reviews on IMDb. Leonardo gets attacked by a bear but survives. Fine, but after this it gets ridiculous. His body is mauled and after his friends carry him for about 2 days, Leo gets buried alive but decides to resurrect and find tom hardy, who killed his son. THe rest of the movie is unrealistic bull crap for a gullible audience. Apart from the fact that Leo almost eats nothing but is able to move his extremely wounded body around amazed me, since i have been in a live threatening situation myself and there is no way that you recover from such injuries so fast in the extreme cold and without any food. Leo also seems untouched by the cold weather and the water because he throws himself in an icy river and when he gets out he doesn't even shiver. A normal person would have hypothermia. He falls with his horse down a huge cliff and survives and when Leo gets chased by 10-20 Indians they all shoot at him but keep missing from close range and Leo EVEN FIRES HIS FLINT LOCK PISTOL TWICE WITHOUT RELOADING!! Come on, did nobody notice this?

I cant believe people give this movie such a high rating but they must be the people who also think a series like the Walking Dead is worth 10/10.
