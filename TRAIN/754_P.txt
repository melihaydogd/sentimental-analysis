Great
I loved this movie so much. I loved Elisabeth Moss's performance if her acting didn't work then we wouldn't believe there is an invisible man but she sells it. I like the cinematography in the movie, I love it when they move the camera to a random spot in the room and we think the invisible man is there and them kinda showing he's somewhere in the room with her, which creates a lot of tension in the scenes. I love the tension in each scene and they do a very good job of capturing tension throughout the whole movie. They have an absolutely stacked cast and they all do an amazing job. I think they did a pretty job at the score it really worked in the tension of the scenes and it elevated each scene and the whole movie and it flowed with each scene it never felt off at all. I felt so bad for the character of Elisabeth Moss because the evidence is right there and the doctors aren't believing her, and everything that happens to her too. They do an amazing job at fleshing out the character of James who is played by Aldis Hodge he also does an amazing job and I cared about him so much throughout the whole story. The story kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and it kept me wanting to learn more or see what was going to happen next. I only have two problems with the movie a bit of the dialogue is bad at times and there are times where the decisions that were made were not logical at all besides that I think it is pretty good. Overall I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.
