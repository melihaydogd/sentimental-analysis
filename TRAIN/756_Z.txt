Harmless fun
Of all the raunchy T&A sex romps made in the seventies and eighties this one is still one of the most popular. A bunch of hot chicks help out Huntz Hall who owns a gas station and of course the competition across the street creates friction when it comes to business so the young lovely's ask their boyfriends to help. As they fix up the place and figure out a way to get customers to show up the girls always find a way of getting naked! How about that? The station across the street is trying to put them out of business. The comedy is not really funny and the whole story is rather hokey but its done with its heart in the right place. How can you hate a film where young girls are trying to save an old mans gas station and get naked? I can't! Veterans Joe E. Ross (Ooo!Ooo!) and Mike Mazurki show up and you cant help but smile as these old pro's add some levity with their experience. Stupid? Yeah, I guess. Silly? Sure! But its harmless fun. Definitely for adults but lower your high brow when you watch this.
