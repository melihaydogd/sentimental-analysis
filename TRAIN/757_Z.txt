Team Flash and sometimes feat. The Flash
This show had a way higher rating from me a few years ago. Now I dropped it to 4 stars. Why?Well it started of really good; A little bit of an insecure Barry learning and training more and more how to use the speedforce.Even though his powers are a LOT weaker than in the comics, it still was a joy to see the guy grow and learn more about his abilitiesA cast that was supporting him (even tho each cw show HAS to have a full team behind the Superhero which takes away from the hero imo)The main focus was on BarryThe main villain up till Zoom had a build up of anticipation and character developmentAnd Now?! of course the infamous line; " NO! WE are the flash!" (should've been foreshadowing of what to come)Barry stopped growing, on the contrary it feels as if his powers are dropping because he alway needs the help of other (more) incompetent people to finish the jobWhines a lot and needs a peptalk every other sceneGets less and LESS screen time, I mean last episode (s06e12) was about 41 minutes long, he was in it for about 5 to 7 minutes!!??The shows constant need to show that Flash isn't the superhero BUT the whole team is.... (especially Iris, egghhhh)The cast REALLY feels bloated now and it really feels like they have to follow a checklist to have a more... 'complete' cast, which takes away from the story andddd the protagonist!Starting to feel like a cheap soap opera about feelings and relationships and all that nonsense (just like what happend with Arrow; It's all about Felicity...)They really should either change the script or call it "Team Flash and sometimes featuring The Flash", but if the show doesn't change quick I'll have to accept it and consider it dead just like Arrow after season 3.
