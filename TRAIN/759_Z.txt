Well made technically , Historically wrong !
I loved the animations , colors & the variety of cultural references , it's visually appealing & the Story has good theme referencing Slavery, honesty & loyalty but the killing part of this Feature animation is the historical faults . I find it really annoying & dishonest to disrespect the historical context , and it really degrades the beauty of the movie & hurts the feelings of the citizens of the countries you referenced in the Movie . Besides the distortion of history in the mind of the young or even the adult who doesn't necessarily have an idea about history of those areas of the world !
