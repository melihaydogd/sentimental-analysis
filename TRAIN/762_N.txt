A decent first film gets an obnoxious, needless sequel.
Let's just say that this film wins the prize for most unnecessary sequel of the year. haters of Pirates 4 and Cars 2, step back.

The film opens with a mission by the Happily Ever After agency, led by Agent Nicky Flippers, to rescue Hansel and Gretel from a witch. Granny gets kidnapped by the witch, and so the big bad wolf goes looking for Red Riding Hood, now a member of an organization "Of the Hood." Joining forces, they go on a mission to discover the mystery behind Granny's disappearance, and what follows is a series of dupes, and fairy tale references. You've been hoodwinked into forking over hard earned money.

Before you ask me exactly WHY I watched the movie, I'll tell you. It's because I liked the first film. Some can fault the first film if they want, but I think its half decent story, clever jokes, and low budget animation charm give it a nice identity. In short, the sequel fails to live up to the first film in any way, it's also the second worst film featuring Red Riding Hood I've seen this year, the first being that boring Amanda Seyfried flick.

The story is forced, under developed, bolted down, and lacking in coherency. The laughs fall especially short of the edge. I can't say it didn't make me laugh a few times, but even that's not enough to cover it. The cast tend to be obnoxious, monotonous, and feel wasted, just like their characters that could have worked if more effort had been put into it. The film's biggest saving grace is its brisk running time of just under 80 minutes. But if you do see this film expecting a good time, prepare to be duped.

I give it *1/2 out of ****
