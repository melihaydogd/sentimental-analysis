Theater of Pain!
Painful to watch. My expectations were higher than what I just watched. It lacked grit and depth, and it came across cheesy. It felt like a very long SNL skit. The narration was flat, I kept seeing Dana Carvey as Vince Neil. Instead of watching a film that validated their baddassery, I walked away from this thinking what a bunch of cartoon characters.
