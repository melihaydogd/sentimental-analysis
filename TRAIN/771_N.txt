Tedious Tedious Tedious
I have to thank this movie for helping me with my studies! After my fianc√©e put it on believing it to be a classic, I blanked out after 15 minutes and chose to write an essay instead (that says something)! I can't fault the acting, but my God the story line was dull. The plot felt really clunky and jumped all over the place. For example, a 20 second scene of a politician being blackmailed to change his vote, with no explanation or mention of it again. Then the twist at the end is that a cop is corrupt, even though he admits to being dirty in Scene #1 - literally.. I'm dumbfounded by the praise on here; it was like a boring version of Black Dahlia.
