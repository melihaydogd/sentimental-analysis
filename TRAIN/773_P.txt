Doesn't deserve the criticism!
Before you see this, you should ask yourself how much you actually like musicals and how much you understand the concept of this musical. I personally thought it was enjoyable and fun. James Corden and Taylor swift are brilliant and it's funny. People in the cinema laughed at the right places and no one walked out. I don't understand why people don't like it!! Jennifer Hudson sings 'memory' amazingly. I think you have to be the 'right' person to see it to be honest.
