Great kids MOVIE!!
Who ever this last post was from(Author: thefonzisgod from Canada ) does not have kids. I'm seriously concerned as to his sanity level when he states' "First off, the characters are very unlikable" .. hey buddy did you look to see that the Characters were not human,, they are guinea pigs!! Geee whizzz it's a fun filled action movie for "KIDS" ... chill and see it for what it is.. a fun action movie.. My kids enjoyed it so much they would love to see it again. The animation and special effects,, CGI and Real were fantastic.. I can see this becoming a series for "KIDS" ... I laughed just as much as the "Kids" did and enjoyed the puns for adults... If your looking for a MI-3 then don't see this movie.. but if your in for a good time go see this movie.. Job well done!
