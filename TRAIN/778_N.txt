An overrated hyped miserable movie! I felt like a movie theater prisoner
Wow, I should have put a clothes pin on my nose before sitting down in the theater because the "Prisoner" just plain stank.And Hugh Jackman is supposed to be better in this than in "Les Miserables?" Good God. Lock up the screwballs who actually tell you this nonsense.  Of course the story line is about two young girls taken while their parents whoop it up in the next room but in no way can this film come close to "Taken." The only one taken is the guy who spends an admission price to see this "Prisoners" bomb. And so with Jackman's daughter and Terence Howard's daughter kidnapped, Terrence keeps cool while Hugh go bonkers beating up everyone in sight. Screaming, effing everyone, banging heads, beating people to a pulp, locking people up in makeshift closets...I mean it's as if Hugh had lost big time at a roulette wheel in the Mirage.  The superior acting belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal, the head detective assigned to the case. He's kept busy as all hell trying to keep a lid on Hugh's head about to explode and on the analyses of data that offer clues to the whereabouts of the young girls. He blinks and twitches during the film but I'm not sure if it's part of the act or fear of wild man Jackman beating him between takes.  The movie is OVERLONG by at least 30-45 minutes. It drags unmercifully. The plot is complicated but I figured out right away that the popcorn was too salty. I'm a BIG Hugh Jackman fan. I've seen him in person on the Broadway stage twice.He's enormously talented but oh how this picture conceals it. SAVE YOUR MONEY or have a clothes pin handy.
