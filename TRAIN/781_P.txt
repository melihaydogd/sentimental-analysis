one of the most underrated movies ever
I'm disappointed to see that this film still hasn't garnered the attnention it deserves. Even back when it came out it did so pretty quietly and was thus buried under other big budget flicks. Rarely though does a comedy keep you entertained and laughing throughout pretty much the entire film. Most comedies try and fail, or take breaks from the humor with someone else to preserve material. But Ferrell and Wahlberg play off of eachother perfectly in this film and have real chemistry to keep the film quality high. This is also one of the mostquotable films ever. 9 years later and my dad and I still shoot off a "I'm a peacock captain, you gotta let me fly", or a "if I were a lion and you were a tuna I'd swim out to the middle of the ocean and freakin eat you" every once in a short while. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of comedy
