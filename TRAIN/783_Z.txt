Original Die Hard 5 script?
OK so since i got to sleep on it. Olympus Has Fallen was a pretty good solid action flick. A little crazy with the CGI as usual in todays modern action movies. I could not help but wonder whether this was the original script for Die Hard 5. All they would have had to do was have John McClane touring the White House and the s**t hits the fan. So many parallels between this and the original Die Hard. Like the stereotypical terrorists who try to fake their own deaths at the end...just to name one. But seriously, it was like watching a rip of Die Hard without John McClane. But Gerard Butler saved the movie from being a complete rip off and it turned out to be an average action flick (only by modern standards). This movie wouldn't hold a light to the 80s gems such as Predator, Terminator, and Die Hard (or basically anything with Stallone or Arnie)
