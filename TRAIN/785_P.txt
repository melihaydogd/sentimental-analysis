With an all star cast I couldn't avoid watching this.
Let me state firstly that this is not the kind of movie I generally watch. I've never been attracted to Dungeons & Dragons style fantasy. With Burt Reynolds as a noble King, Ray Liotta as the evil magician, Jason Statham as the orphan farmer/hero and Leelee Sobieski as the fly in the ointment I felt obliged to give it a try. All of these, and more, actors gave a splendid performance.

The overall production is excellent and the movie flows along at a good pace. The story is nothing new but interesting enough none the less. It provided me with 2.5+ hours of entertainment so I give it 7/10.
