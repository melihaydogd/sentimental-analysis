Great movie, funny, good story, a must see
Before Logan, this was my favorite non-MCU marvel movie. The humor lands every single time thanks to Ryan Reynolds' charismatic and hysterical performance. The action was really well-helmed, which i think benefits from the fact that none of it is censored (disney if u make DP3 don't censor it). It also does a great job fleshing out Wade Wilson's character, instead of making him a service-level comedian; they showed us his prior life and love life, and it was executed very well. Overall, this is a badass and hilarious x-men film, and a really damn good time.
