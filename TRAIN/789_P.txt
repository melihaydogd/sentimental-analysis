What "Die Hard 5" should have been...
Well Gerard Butler is back to his roots on what he does best. Instead of constantly doing romantic comedies, which some are watchable. But he is just better with these types or roles. The actions and character interactions are quite predictable and generic but the direction it goes makes this a entertaining popcorn flick. Especially since the people in the White House or has anything to do with the White House are all just darn charismatic. It has Aaron Eckhart as the president of the United states and he is a tough and charismatic president. If I think of a modern day American president, Aaron Eckhart just pops in my head or at least someone that looks similar to him. And it even has Morgan Freeman as the speaker of the house...Nuff said. And Rick Yune who is basically a North Korean terrorist actually somewhat stands out as the main villain. Well at least way more than Will Yun Lee from the crappy "Red Dawn" reboot. The plot is basically about the North Korean terrorists taking over the White House and only one man is capable or at least put in the situation to fight back. And although some parts just gets really dumb, it's still entertaining to a degree. When it comes to action movies this is generic as it gets for the most part. But it's just very entertaining to watch Gerard Butler as the secret service guy kicking ass and taking names. Overall this is a very watchable popcorn flick. And is a good throwback to the 90's action movies even if some of the one-liners can get really really cheesy.7/10
