If 'Bohemian Rhapsody' had an illegitimate child it would be 'The Dirt'. It's an enjoyable movie although lacking any sense of drama in the dramatic sequences. It was the equivalent of one of those bad TV movies about behind the scenes of a popular sitcom. Fans may recall the events and escapades of the band during their heyday and hopefully the music will gain the band a new following.
