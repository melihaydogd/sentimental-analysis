I want two hours of my life back
An awful, awful movie. Like one of the viewers said, it is cheap in all aspects. To those people who haven't seen this film, please stay away from this junk at all cost. Go Watch some wholesome, soul-lifting contemporary Russian art movies like the Return and then see how cheap this movie is. But this is totally a piece of stinking garbage. Violence need not to be portrayed in such an outlandish, vulgar style. The camera movement almost made me throw up. Editing is almost not-existent. A cheap, cheap movie that to the greatest irony won so many undeserving awards. People who raved about this film are idiots. Critics too. It is just pathetic. Even Hollywood movies are one hundred times better as much as I don't like them
