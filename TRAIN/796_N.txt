hopeless drivel
This film represents everything that is bad about Hollywood and the big studios. The fact that this dreadful meaningless screen play was allowed to be turned into a multi-million dollar production is a sad indictment of everyone involved, not least Sean Connery who is clearly one of the most avaricious and least discerning actors around.

The dialogue is trite beyond belief and the plot line riddled with holes the size of the Titanic (and don't get me started on that...) The sad thing is that a huge amount of resources and time went into making this nonsense which could have been used so much more profitably.

Avoid like the plague
