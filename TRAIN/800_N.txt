Sometimes Absurdity is Fun, Other Times, it's just, well, Absurd!
D.J. Caruso is not a filmmaker, he is a film-taker. While everyone knows that his horrible film, Disturbia, was a blatant rip off of Rear Window, many do not that this movie is almost as blatant but Caruso manages to rip off more than one movie this time. There are strong elements of Hitchcock's films, North by Northwest and The Wrong Man. It also borrows from Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, but mostly, 2001: A Space Odyssey. This movie is nothing but an unoriginal piece of Hollywood trash with some okay suspense and a load of bad product placement.

I didn't really have a problem with the acting. I always enjoy Shia LaBeouf, Billy Bob Thornton was good, and Michelle Monaghan was decent. The story is lame and has been done so much better so many times before. I wish I hadn't gone to this crapfest and I will be staying away from Caruso's movies from now on.

The only thing D.J. Caruso has done for film is make crappy versions of movies that people already love. There is no need for this man and I hope he realizes it soon. I hope you do too!
