Another worst film! Too many talking! The action not intense and bored! Not recommended!
This film start with a man "Pete" talking on the phone, he sent away his wife "Sofia" to a shelter, and he have a mission to infiltrate the drug dealer with the FBI scene! As turnout, this film is about Pete need to get into the prison to help his mob boss running the drug business, he also need to help the FBI to infiltrate a target criminal in the prison and another NYPD officer "Grens" also suspect Pete murder his colleague! Entire film quite slow and full of boring conversation! The action also not intense and not satisfy! Barely intense scene is, Grens saving Pete's wife and daughter from the killing of a bunch of mobster! This scene have shooting at the leg and at the head scene! A bit bloody! At the end, Pete capture a warden as a hostage, he wearing the warden uniform to distract the police! The police eventually shot dead the warden, Pete survive from the explosion of the gas tank! The FBI agent "Wilcox" helping Pete escape from the ambulance! At the very end, Grens ask Pete to stay away awhile before met up with his wife and daughter! That's it! Another disappointed film!
