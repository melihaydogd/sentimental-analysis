Killing is no fun if you make it look real
Again, unnecessary violent scenes in this movie made me sick. Avoid at all costs unless you are looking for a horror genre. Twisted by all means,stay away. Similar scenes were in Seven Psychopaths or for example in This Is the End.

I will remind you , This Is the End, Violence & Gore 8/10 , "A bloody, severed leg is visible. A woman's head is accidentally crushed by a fleeing party goer, with blood briefly shown spurting. Another person is impaled by a lamp-post, with massive amounts of blood spurting from his chest as he expresses bewilderment. Very graphic and gory. " 

Or , Seven Psychopaths,Violence & Gore 8/10 , "A man drags a straight razor across his throat and we see the slit open and blood gushing from the wound."

And that should be labeled as comedy ? I would say no. Those scenes are not funny when done in such realistic way.

I will leave for you to check for yourself Motion Picture Rating for Kingsman: The Secret Service.
