rich and beautiful people have problems too
My girlfriend dragged me to the cinema to see this flick, and when she fell asleep after 15 minutes, and despite not being a drinker, I wish I had smuggled in more than one beer. Like most films and series it is set in a fantasy world most of us don't have access to. A boy who's biggest problem seems to be getting away from his loaded dad and depressed 'don't know what to do with my free time' mother, and which woman to pursue. The stunningly beautiful one, or the stunningly beautiful one. Granted, I'm simplifying, and the story does build, but I just cannot fake any interest in these type of ivory tower characters anymore.
