Bad, so bad
This show sucked. It starts out ok.. an alcoholic, promiscuous flight attendant wakes up in bed next to a dead guy. Then the show goes downhill from there. She runs around acting drunk and stupid with no regard for the people around her. There are these weird, terrible flashbacks to when she was a child that really add nothing to the show. Then she falls in love with a dead guy, whom she had just met and spent the night with ONCE, by creating a relationship with him in her head while she's trying to solve his murder? Their "relationship" is strange and a total force. Any time he pops in her head it starts with her saying something corny like "oh no not again" or "this isn't the best timing"... just really.. really.. stupid. Her best friend is a lawyer with a really old flip phone and is dealing with some sketchy people but they never explain why or what she was really doing. There were a lot of bunnies for no reason.. the finale was awful. I hated it lol
