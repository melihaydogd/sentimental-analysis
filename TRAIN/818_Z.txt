The fans killed it
I hear all the hype on social media how this is the best show ever and it&#39;s referenced a lot. however, it&#39;s not as good as it is said to be by others. it&#39;s something someone could get high to and not really pay attention to but can still keep up with. I often find myself on my phone while trying to watch this show. I mean, it&#39;s not bad but it&#39;s not good.
