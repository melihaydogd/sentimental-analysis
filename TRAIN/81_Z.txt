Started well but quickly became unrealistic
Well done initially, but as the first season progressed the dramas piled on like Twister players. Completely unbelievable by the end. The final straw was when the parents decided to have a baby in the midst of it all. Yes, that's definitely the way to cope with the recently departed grandparent, the co-parent with substance abuse issues, and the FIVE teens or tweens, several of whom have had serious behavioral issues in the past year, one of whom was recently adopted, and one of whom remains in a gray limbo zone of foster-childness, complicated by her ongoing attraction to her alleged brother-to-be. Yep. Perfect time to have a baby.
