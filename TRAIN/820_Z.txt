Tedious, long winded, beautifully shot
"The Handmaiden" is a fairly tedious, hard-to-follow art movie.It looks great, like a photography book come to life... sort of. But just because it's nice to look at, doesn't mean it's fun to watch.The story is told in three parts, each introduced by an on-screen title. The movie goes back and forth on the timeline a bit.It's so long-winded in parts that I stopped caring who everyone was and what they were doing. This is anathema in any movie, but more so for one that fills you in after the fact.I am generally loath to assume that the only reason someone says they like an adults only movie is because of the sex. Here, I have to make an exception. Yes, it does have some fairly graphic lesbian scenes - though not much compared to "Blue is the Warmest Colour". And yes, this lesbianism is between two pretty, young Korean actresses.Supposedly, at least most guys love to see women make out, and most of them also have a preference for Asian women. I realise I am an anomaly in not being that excited by either. And take the sex out of the movie, and what do you have?A photography book you'd enjoy flipping through, but not enough of a story to make you want to take it home.
