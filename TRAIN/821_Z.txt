Very mediocre at best.
How did Brie Larson get an Oscar for this?! She didn&#39;t even do that much. The screen time manly went to the kid playing Jack. Idk, but Brie&#39;s parts didn&#39;t seem whole. It came across as the parts had been cut, a lot!<br/><br/>The story itself is something horrible and is still happening everyday in this world. However, I didn&#39;t shed a tear once!! And I can get very! emotional ...<br/><br/>The kid playing Jack did a pretty fantastic job with the script he got. But overacting got quite annoying a couple of times- the director&#39;s fault though.<br/><br/>I wouldn&#39;t watch it. It is extremely mediocre.
