Something old, something older
Action steamrolls, with the aid of a fast shaky digicam. Computers can make anything (I mean ANYTHING) happen - in this film (not giving any spoilers here) the idea is that if they can tap into your phone, it means they could also turn it on and spy on you after you turned it off. That means they could remotely control anything remotely electrical even if it's not in any way linked to any network or internet.

The first Bourne was great, the second was super hot, but less realistic - and this movie takes all of that, along with all the bad 'net spying on you' themes and ramps them up to a completely incredulous story that will have everyone saying 'wow, NO way'.

Sorry, but the action isn't as good as other movies, and there's nothing in the story - so why bother?
