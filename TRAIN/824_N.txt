The Worst Pseudo-Playing Ever!
How did Adrien Brody win best actor when he couldn't even convincingly "fake play" the piano? Every time he sat down at the piano, I rolled my eyes and felt so embarrassed for him: here goes again the utterly ridiculous head sways and the faulty positioning of the hands on the keyboard! The scene in which he plays for the Nazi guy was the most hilarious: The Nazi is supposed to be "inspired" and "touched" by his playing, but because Brody looks so awful, all one can think about is how truly awful it must have sounded while filming; there was no suspension of disbelief. Brody has been awarded for FAILING--that's totally unfair! If you want a truly inspiring and believable performance, then watch "Shine". Geoffrey Rush does a spectacular job at pseudo-playing the piano--he won't make you cringe or laugh in embarrassment.
