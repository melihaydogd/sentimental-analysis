Hollywood Should Not Re-Do Foreign Art
If you are a preteen, the story may work for you. If you have any common sense, the bad dialogue and blatant attempted remake of every Ghost In The Shell misunderstanding will drive you crazy.

Special effects are decent, and the story moves along at a decent pace. However Johansson should go do spinster sitcom not action or superhero movies. She is a one dimensional character with a digitally botoxed face that walks like an ape. I would never watch this movie again.
