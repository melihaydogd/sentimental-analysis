One of the most pointless movies I have ever seen...perhaps I missed something?
A fictional creature created for the purpose of feeding an already overfed society. The acting was great, but the story didn't capture me; it makes me wonder what the writers and producers of the movie aimed to stir up among their viewers. Whatever it was, I may have been more intrigued if they had chosen to tell the story of the many non-fictional livestock that are bred to die; such stories hardly require a fictional twist.
