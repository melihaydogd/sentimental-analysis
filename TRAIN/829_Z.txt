Long but effective all-black production...
Director King Vidor also produced and worked on the screenplay for this amazing early talkie, a pet project of the filmmaker's which was touted to be the first picture with an all-black cast (it was later revealed to be the second). The rise and fall of black preacher Brother Zekiel (Daniel L. Haynes) in the sweaty, sinful South is filled with vivid performances and stunning dramatic moments, though the movie tends to exhaust one with its overlength and hallelujah choruses. Engrossing and emotional, nevertheless, with a memorable finale. The original treatment was by Richard Schayer, with dialogue by Ransom Rideout and narrative structure from Wanda Tuchock. **1/2 from ****
