Not as powerful as I had hoped
Platoon does well to portray the hopeless and wild emotions of US soldiers as they faced a war that seemed random, pointless, and inexplicable. I think it focused a little too much on the random and pointless, putting lower emphasis on the confusing emotions that the soldiers probably felt. That made me occasionally feel like the movie itself was pointless rather than allowing me to sympathize with the men, so I think the film missed the mark for me.
