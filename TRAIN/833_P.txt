Almost perfect
As Tarantino as it gets. Reservoir Dogs is exactly what you&#39;d expect from him. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s gory, it&#39;s brutal and above all else, it&#39;s absolutely ridiculous. This movie could&#39;ve been so incredible, but unfortunately, it slightly misses the mark.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie is, no doubt, what everyone else loved as well. Those scenes in the warehouse are spectacular. The fact that you can make conversations between people so intense and thrilling is remarkable. And this movie nails that. Every scene in the warehouse is perfect. You never know what is going to happen and you are constantly on the edge of your seat. Had this movie been entirely in the warehouse, I&#39;m sure I would&#39;ve liked it way more.<br/><br/>As is though, the movie doesn&#39;t do that. It almost feels like Tarantino knew how intense those warehouse scenes were and decided that the viewer needed a break. As such, the film goes on to give introductions to some of the characters. These introductions, however, felt completely unnecessary to me. Not only did they break the pace and intensity of the film, but they also broke the mystery and intrigue of the characters. I would&#39;ve been perfectly fine with never knowing anything but the made-up names that each character had. Especially the introduction of Mr. Orange felt unnecessarily long and added very little to the overall story.<br/><br/>This movie could&#39;ve been near perfect had it kept true to its intensity and the thrill of the post heist moments. Using that confined location and nothing else and pitting these characters against each other in an endless barrage of doubt and accusation would&#39;ve truly been a sight to behold. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat the whole time, especially considering the relatively short runtime. Alas, I was forced to take breaks and breathe for a moment just be brought back into the excellence of the warehouse.<br/><br/>With all that being said, it&#39;s still a great movie. It has all the characteristics you&#39;d want from a Tarantino film and it is immensely entertaining even in the slower moments. It probably isn&#39;t a classic yet, but it undoubtedly will be one in the future. As far as I&#39;m concerned, it wasn&#39;t as good as it could&#39;ve been, but that&#39;s just my opinion. And based on most reviews that I&#39;ve read many consider it to be as good as it could&#39;ve ever been.
