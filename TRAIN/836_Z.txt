Clever thriller
But not as clever as others have made out. The first hour is confusing, its supposed to be. The whole point of this film is to keep you guessing until the final scene where the whole thing comes together. I just thought that the final revelation wasn't that mind-blowing and a bit disappointing. One other point that I didn't think was too realistic was how quickly everybody around the main character accepted and adapted to his condition in order to exploit him.

All in all its a good film with excellent performances from Pearce and Moss and is different to anything else I've ever seen - 7/10.
