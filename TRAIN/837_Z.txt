Highly overrated
For a movie that supposedly costs $50M to make - it had a low-budget feel to it - e.g. the movie consistently used the same group of extras to portray the reactions of the hoi polloi in the "V" universe - this is simply lazy and unpolished movie making; what little of the special effects used in the movie were of the run-of-the-mill variety. As for action sequences - they were mainly confined to a brief sequence near the end. As action sequences go, one can easily find lower budget HK kungfu movies that will deliver significantly more punch (pun intended). The storyline - adapted from a comicbook novel - was ordinary and nowhere near the epiphany-inducing, mind-blowing, jaw-dropping experiences documented by many reviewers. As a whole, the movie does not live up to its 8+ rating in IMDb. At best a 5/10...
