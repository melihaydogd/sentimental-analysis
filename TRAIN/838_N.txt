 The most over-hyped movie of all-time.
All right I might be wrong... considering I haven't and wouldn't dare waste my time watching the 2 sequels. Now before you start email bombing me let me give a chance to explain myself a little. I'm not gonna sit here and say this movie was horrible. That's going too far. A lot of time and effort obviously went into the making of this film. The production values are great, the scenery is sometimes beautiful, the special effects are decent, and the directing could have been a lot worse. You see, I'm not gonna be some idiot who posts "THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS COMPLETE CRAP" and rates it a 1. I actually rated this movie a 3. That being said... the acting is far from impressive. The story certainly didn't grab be nearly enough to be interested in wasting another 3+ plus hours a piece on a sequel. The whole thing basically screamed blah to me. A movie that at best could be considered decent. The fact that this movie (along with the 2 sequels) sits comfortably on the top 10 movies OF ALL TIME is really scary to me. Do people grasp the concept "of all time". We're not talking about the best film of the year here. There have been tens of thousands of movies made since the invention of cinema... do you people really believe that the 3 LOTR movies surpass all of those movies? Wow, what a one in a billion coincidence that would be. It makes me think most of the people who rated this movie have only seen about 5-10 movies in their life. Do people forget such cinematic achievements as Taxi Driver, Rashomon, A Clockwork Orange, and Reservoir Dogs, just to name a few. I take some solace at the fact that 55% of the people who rated this movie gave it a 10, proving that most of these people are either fanatical or just trying to drive this movie up the IMDB ladder of all-time greats. But hey, to each his own. The fantasy genre has never been one of my favorites... maybe I'm crazy.... but i doubt it.
