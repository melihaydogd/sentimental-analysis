To avoid being taken away to a nursing home, an old widower tries to fly his home to Paradise Falls, South America, along with a boy scout who accidently lifted off with him.
.......so that's what this movie was about? And all this time, one of my friends told me it was an old man flying to South America to pay tribute to his deceased wife! Turns out the movie is about Oldie McFart refusing to stay in a probably comfortable nursing home. I'm glad he got trapped up in the sky with that boy and that dog. Giving this one star and blaming my friend.
