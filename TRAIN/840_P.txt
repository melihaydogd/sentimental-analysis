Gripping till the end
Clint Eastwood at his best- acted, directed, produced brilliance! His depth of character where he went from a killer maverick to faithful husband, even the depiction of the movie from start to end from the point of view of his wife's decision to marry him, all brilliant. Every scene established the character or plot without meaningless violence.
