Funniest action movie I've ever seen! Great action - horrible story!
I haven't laughed so hard in an R-action movie in so long, I think I snorted at one point. It's a shame because I'm a Morgan Freeman fan and I like Gerard Butler - but this movie was horribly hysterical. It had true potential, started out great and I thought it would've been taken in a whole other (non-bs) way. The premise of the story made no sense - that everyone would choose to save the president instead of the rest of the world? The president actually encourages the others to give up their nuc codes to the terrorists? Way funny. I mean, truthfully, if you want a good laugh then this might do the trick! Save for less than a handful of scenes this could've played like an action spoof movie. The action was good, I mean I have to be convinced the only reason Butler took the role was so he could shoot a bunch of things. And to the same token, Morgan Freeman must've taken his role because he got to act as president of the United States. Nevertheless this movie fails to be what it's supposed to be, and succeeds at everything it's not. One of my favorite comedies for sure.
