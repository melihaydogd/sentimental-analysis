Aronofsky's passion project is kind of a masterpiece.
First off, you should not plan to see Noah because it is a biblical epic, nor should you plan to skip Noah precisely because it is a biblical epic. You should however, see Noah because it is an amazing film, using the basic story of Noah's ark to deliver a fantasy action/adventure and a psychological horror story and deliver a very relevant ecological message that's subtle. The visuals are out of this world, particularly one scene depicting the creation of the universe from the big bang to a scientifically accurate representation of what Darwinian evolution would look like sped up about a million times, the whole scene would feel right at home in an episode of Cosmos. (Yes, you read that right.) Special mention must be made to Russel Crowe, who delivers the complicated picture of a man that both saves the world but is also supposed to let it die, and all of the weight one must feel about it. I can't praise this movie enough, it's basically perfect, if you are even the least bit curious about going, do so! You won't regret it.
