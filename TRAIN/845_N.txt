horrible!
I couldn't agree more with oqonac. This may be not only the worst sequel ever, but the worst horror movie ever! Nowadays, certain filmmakers think by throwing a name or specific place ( e.c. Magik, X-force), into the movie they're creating an acceptable sequel. This movie took 90 minutes of my life away, and I demand them back! (I know I should have had the smarts to walk out of the theater!)
