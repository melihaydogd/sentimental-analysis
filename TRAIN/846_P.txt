This is definitely like watching a moving artistic masterpiece!!
It is so gorgeous and beautiful to look at and I guess being from Texas, I find it comforting. Obviously Kevin has gotten better with age! Hot Daddy! They scored big time to get Kelly Reilly in this! I still tear up when I think of her character in ""Flight"! She is one powerful actress who really puts her heart out there! I am in love with this show! I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at this. It is enjoyable to let play in the background or focus on intently. It doesn't try to own you, it just offers you everything to take in as you please.
