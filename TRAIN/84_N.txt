Not quite sure about all the hype...
Don't get me wrong it was suspenseful at times (insert suspenseful music here) and was supported by an outstanding cast.. though it is just very predictable. From the start we see that Mills is a weak rookie detective who makes the most simple of mistakes even when being pleaded not to. So we know he will be victimized at the conclusion of the film.. How hard was it for me to take a wild guess and say that the press guy attempting to take photos at the scene of the crime was in fact our serial killer "John Doe"...... not very hard I must admit. The fact that the director had to bring to our attention that Mill's wife Tracy is pregnant and hiding it from Mills tells us that something gruesome is going to happen to her or the baby in the end... and all it's doing is creating a little more suspense.. but yet still easily predictable.. The only reason I finished the film was the slightest hope of something unpredictable happening. And unfortunately I never got that.. so I wasted about two hours.I feel for anyone who is a logical thinker that watched this.. likely the only person this film could catch off guard is somebodies 70yr old grandmother.
