Very Overrated!!
This movie looked like it was created by 11 year old kids for whom sex was just a rumor. I disliked the movie a lot. I didn't like the story and the acting of the movie. This could have been a lot better if it was just like the original Guy Fawkes story. I didn't like the character V in the movie I thought he sucked. I gave it 3 because the acting of Natalie Portman was pretty good. She was the only thing I liked in the film. Natalie had good acting but the support wasn't good at all. The film could have had better dialogoues which it didn't. I felt very bored while watching this film. All in all the film was very boaring and I hated it.
