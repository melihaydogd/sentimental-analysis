One of the most ambitious comicbook films of all time
Merely a live action adaptation based off of one of the most celebrated graphic novels of all time 'Watchmen', directed by the visionary filmmaker of 'Man of Steel' and '300', Zack Snyder, comes a true masterpiece of a film with an unforgettable cast.

Aside from this film being an adaptation it was very unique yet at the same time very balsy for Zack Snyder to pull of this project after Alan Moore had said nobody could replicate or adapt his novel, well it might just have been reborn on the big screen in the most epic and complex way possible.

The VFX process of Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan was sufficent for its time, I was able to see the freckles on his back, just such great detail with the power of the effects, with the right amount as well not overstuffed, not that this film would need to rely on the effects, it is definitely better than the new Watchmen show on HBO, not that It was Yayha Abdul Mateen's fault, it was just a very poor representation of the comic.

This is a very underrated comicbook film not just for comicbook film but for film in general. This movie was truly was ahead of its time, I guarantee if it was released today it would have gotten the attention and praise it deserves, thankfully it is slowly getting some with its growing relevance throughout the years, it'll age like fine Wine.
