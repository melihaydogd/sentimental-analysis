What a stupid movie
What was the purpose of having a stellar cast? Waste of time, the story was purposeless and no direction. What was this movie trying to be? Because it was definitely not a thriller, not a drama and not a romance genre. And it wasn't the kind of movie that let you go into deep though either. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Do not waste your time.
