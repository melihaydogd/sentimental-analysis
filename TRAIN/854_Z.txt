The book, the movie, etc.
One pleasant aspect of having read a previous review of this film by some professional critic -- then having decided to avoid it because it was purportedly not true to the original story -- is that when I did give it a try on rerun TV I sort of liked it.True, it is if nothing else a woman's movie, filled with sentimental clich√©s and other oddly familiar images. But the cinematography is quite appealing, as are those odd images reminiscent of just about every American-goes-to-(you name the European country)-and-finds-(romance, thrills, the meaning of life,etc.) film ever made.Apart from its travelogue flavor, there are just enough scenes involving adequate direction and acting to keep the thing from falling by the wayside, and the casting is jolly. I quite liked Sandra Oh in her part, and "Pavel" is obviously a caricature of the young John Paul II. Then there are the hilarious and rather tongue-in-cheek reminders of Fellini. One wonders if the author is making fun of herself just a bit, given that the book from which all this started is so much more serious, complex, and engaging.
