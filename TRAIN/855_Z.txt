Not for those over the age of 12
Four times in as many movies, Blue Sky Studios has proved itself a distant third when it comes to CGI film-making. Like the Ice Age movies before it, Horton Hears a Who coasted on the big-name talent behind the mic, ignoring the clever styling and over-their-heads adult humor that have made Pixar -- and, to a lesser extent, Dreamworks -- so successful. All in all, your kids will probably be entertained for 90 minutes, but Horton really is nothing more than cinematic cotton candy: empty calories and completely forgettable.

As for the cast, Carell shows a real flair for voice-over work, while Carrey's performance left something to be desired. One doesn't realize how much of his shtick involves facial expressions, which don't come through very well on an elephant's computerized visage. The lesser players -- notably Isla Fisher -- turn in some very good work.

The animation was fair, but nowhere near the quality or detail of a Pixar pic. But the real problem with Horton was the dialog. It just wasn't funny. Even the small children in the audience laughed only occasionally, and I chuckled only once during the movie's thankfully short run-time. Perhaps the writers felt compelled to remain true to Seuss's original work, as they seemed to add very little originality and a whole lot of benign filler.

So unless you're dying to get the kids out of the house and don't mind dropping $10 a head at your local AMC, wait for Horton to hit the bargain bin and save for you money for WALL-E this summer.
