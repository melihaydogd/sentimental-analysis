Better Than Critics Say
Why critics trashed this film is beyond me. It's actually quite entertaining. Berry pulls off the role very nicely, and Stone portrays the villainess with a nice, icey edge. Bratt is good as the hero/cop as well. The soundtrack is kicking and the story line is never boring. The most unfortunate thing I can think of saying about this film is that it had the misfortune of opening up against bigger blockbuster films like the Bourne Supremacy and I, Robot, while Spiderman 2 was still going strong also. This is a good little action-type movie that should be given a chance. Ignore the critics (I ALWAYS do) and check it out for yourself. Though this film is no comparison to Star Wars in any way shape or form, I read somewhere that critics (as usual) trashed that too. See it and then decide for yourself.
