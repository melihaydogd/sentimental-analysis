A Beautiful Movie
GARDEN STATE is the perfect blend of comedy, drama, and romance in my opinion. It's a bit of a tragedy, but not. It's filled with hope and sadness. It will make you laugh and cry.

The acting is wonderful. The directing is wonderful as well, especially for a first timer. This is the exactly the kind of film I could watch over and over again. Highly recommend.
