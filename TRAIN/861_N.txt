Skip the first 40 minutes
The acting is BAD and the first half of the movie is a lot of unnecessary character development. I guess no one ever told Sly that when you&#39;re on the 5th movie in a franchise we don&#39;t need that much time to get reacquainted with the main character. I gave it 3 stars because the action sequences have some pretty cool moments but, besides that the movie is a waste of time. This was really disappointing for me because I thought the 2008 Rambo was awesome. I probably watched that one 20 times, this one I&#39;ll probably never watch again...
