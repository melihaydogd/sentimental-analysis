another garbage sex comedy movie ,total waste of a script
Well...American Virgin is another comedy movie that has lots of sex and nudity scenes along with vulgar humor and a story that missed the whole point of it (showing Priscillia's hard life after she's being a well known porn star and her denial to it maybe...).

The whole movie is simply not funny and most of the developments aren't good nor interesting not mentioning how boring it is -pretty dry and dreadful for me...the cast and the script weren't good and most of the characters didn't really have any impact on the story. And besides -the whole end *(big spoiler here)* was really cheesy and unrealistic not mentioning how stupid it was when Priscillia found out she wasn't the naked girl in the tape....lame.

In conclusion: waste of time -not a good movie at all.
