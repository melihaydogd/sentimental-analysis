So, I am interested, but hoping this get's somewhere faster.
So, I will hit the pros and cons for this (I will update this review over the shows run)Pros:I like the actors, they do good with their script and their onscreen chemistry is great I like a lot of the loose plotholes this show is tying up. There were a lot of them left dangling and so they should be wrapped up. (Zemo, Other Winter Soldiers) I like they are shedding light on forgotten Avengers like Winter Soldier and Falcon. It was good when they did that in Wandavision and it is important to remember supporting charactersNow, for my least favorite/favorite part of a review: the cons(I will try to be quick as I am fond of this show and while it has flaws my low rating will get higher)It is taking a long time to build up. For Wanda Vision it worked well, but for such a quick paced show it needs to get somewhere faster We kind of skipped over Sam's family issues and Bucky's trauma in favor of more action. While I like action, those were important story elements.There are too many names to keep up with and it isn't explained well what is going on. That I think they could have done better.Final thoughts:It is too early to review this show. I am leaving my review so far and intend to update it, so most of the issues will probably get addressed. If you are questioning the authenticity of my review, be aware it is of the quality of the show itself and how I feel, for clarification, so this is my opinion and please feel free to disagree.
