NOT Disney/Pixar quality
I honestly can't believe I'm writing this but this movie falls so completely flat. I realllly wanted to like Onward but the storyline drags and leaves nothing to the imagination. It's incredibly predictable and even the "funny" parts feel forced. I watched this with 3 other people who were all ready to turn it off. We kept going because, hey, it was free and we didn't have anything else to watch. If I'd have seen this in theatres and paid $17 a ticket, I'd be extremely disappointed.
The entire film feels forced. Which sucks because I absolutely adore Tom Holland and Chris Pratt....
