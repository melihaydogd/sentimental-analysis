strongly mixed feelings - a film split in two
It was very hard to rate this movie since it should really be split in two. The beginning, I loved. Were are not given much to know, and perhaps we didn't need to know anything. the cinematography is great, the music is adequate, the actors are very good.  Though, I always say that the great qualities Wim Wenders has as a film maker, he lacks when it comes to scenarios. In the second half of the movie we are given to understand the typical, unoriginal, backstory to the whole situation. The back story is not interesting, and it is also told to us in a very unoriginal and, I think, all to direct way.   My recommendation is to watch this movie halfway, or 3/4. if I had done that i probably would have given this movie an 8 or a 9. sadly, I watched it until the end (like a normal person), and all the mysteriousness, slight absurdity, feel of the plot, situation, etc. and all the endearing qualities that the characters had, were destroyed. the ending is also completely unrealistic. here it is important to make a difference between what I say "surrealist", or "strange", which is in a way voluntarily unrealistic, and unrealistic which I mean as "wants to be realistic, but fails at it miserably".   knowing that the second half is terrible, I would still watch this movie again, and almost gave it a 7
