It was OK, not terrible.
OK, so i borrowed this movie from a buddy, and watched it by myself. I wasn't expecting much when i started it.. And i didn't get much. Just lots of boobies. But that has to be the only good thing about this movie. There is hardly any plot for it. And what little there is just dissolves towards the end of the movie.

As for the acting.. It's not great.. but watchable. It's a real shame that Rob Schneider is doing movies like this now.

But anyway, if you just want a movie with a large amount of nudity in it, then just watch this.

I Give it a 2* out of 5*

Enjoy.
