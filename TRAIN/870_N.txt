If you love SAW you will love this...
Now I'm no hater of violence in films and I rather enjoy a good horror.The two leads are both actors I usually enjoy and they both give good performances is this.The film making and camera work in this film are very, very good.It's well acted and I think the director and script writers got the film they wanted.So what is the reason I have scored this a "2"?Well it's "torture porn", it may even be the first of the current seemingly never ending proliferation of titles and I just can't see the attraction on on-ending suffering and pain as the subject of a film. The only reason for such films seems to me to show increasingly nasty ways of maiming and killing people. If that kind of film is what you enjoy then watch this as it is certainly better made and acted than most of the genre, but it's not for me.
