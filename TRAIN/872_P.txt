A Feast for the Soul...
Taking great ingredients including but not limited to, an endearing story with meaning and a message, superb and breathtaking animation, brilliantly voiced narration and as cute a rattus rattus you&#39;re ever likely to encounter. Combined, refined, formed and baked to perfection, the result, a jaw dropping piece of film that you can perpetually admire, enjoy and savour.
