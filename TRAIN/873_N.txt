Horrible Movie
Horrible movie, with a cheap budget of production. Three rooms, four unknown actors with a horribly written script.

The entire story could have been done and dusted in 30 minutes. Lots of waffle, no content.

The guys giving this movie high scores either work for the production company, or have a very very weird sense of good films.

Lots of uncalled for nudity, and bad language.

Lot's of repetition and weird sick sexuality.

It's one of these films that you see and think: Oh GOD, sitting on the toilet for the same amount of time would have been more productive.
