Overrated mix of typical American Hollywood hero and sloppy storyline
I really don't understand what everyone's great fascination is with this movie. There are a couple of good scenes, that are funny and have the right emotional level. There are some twists, that are way too predictable or too easily brushed off. While I used to like McConahey's acting, I think he has been way too over the top with his role in this one. I liked Anne Hathaway in a few of the scenes, as well as the daughter though. Character development is basically non-existent and I was pretty bored multiple times during the movie which left me disconnected to the characters and not caring about the end of the story. I really just hoped it would end at some point.

While the science behind it is truly fascinating, the movie is neither outstanding nor is the story. It has potential but is just so underdeveloped.
