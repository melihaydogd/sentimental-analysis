Bad bad casting
Miles Teller was supposed to play the lead role ...knowing that..Ryan G is too old. And Emma Watson would have been so much better than ES. The casting is really bad and the ad lib is annoying..it's like being in a terrible acting class when they do annoying "say the same line back and forth"...ugh! And I hate the ending...they must have added that..it made no sense!
