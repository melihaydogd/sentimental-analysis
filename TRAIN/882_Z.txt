Yes Man lazy, predictable and somewhat dull. Not Jim Carrey's best effort.
Jim Carrey is up to his usual comedic shtick in this lazy, predictable and somewhat dull comedy. Nothing new really goes on that I haven't seen before from Carrey or in other similar movies of this kind.

Yes man basically feels like it was put together by committee with little thought put into it. A very run-of-the-mill effort. The one joke premise leads to a mediocre execution.

Yes man made me laugh very little. I've seen comedies that were far better than this one. I had trouble staying awake while watching. It bored me most of the way through.

Although, I'm a Jim Carrey fan his is not his best outing and far from his funniest comedy. He's done better in the past.
