One Of Disney's Better Efforts
Wowzer! Overall, this is a very entertaining movie, one of the best kids' films I've ever seen. Once Matthew Broderick is turned into "Inspector Gadget," the film becomes very inventive with a lot of cool gadgets and a lot of neat things to see and hear (great movie for surround sound.)

Broderick is a likable hero and even Rupert Everett as the villain is, too, producing some laughs. There are enough adult-type jokes to clever material to make this fun for us older folks. I'd have to say this is one of the better efforts ever by the Disney company.

Broderick plays two roles, and is especially funny as the counterfeit Gadget with the fake teeth. The little girl in here is cute, too, and the talking car has some of the best lines of the film. At under 80 minutes, the film breezes by at good clip.
