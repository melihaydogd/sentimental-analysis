Elektra
Elektra is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is Jam Packed with Excitement and Adventure ranging from Martial Arts to very Powerful Characters. On the subject of Characters this Film has them spot on my favourite two being Elektra herself and Typhoid as they remind me so much of myself. Elektra being as cold as she is and Typhoid that can bring death to anything she Touches of course I don't bring death just a lot of pain and anguish. But I found as Phsycotic as the Characters may be I could really relate to them. Also Elektra carrying the best weapon ever invented by man the Sai's really entranced me into this Film it was just great and there was not one boring moment.
