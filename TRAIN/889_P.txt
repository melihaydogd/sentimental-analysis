I loved this film. I think it tells a beautiful love story rather than a violent, dark movie that some people would like to label it as. What makes this all the more amazing is that The Crow was almost trashed when the late Brandon Lee was accidentally shot and killed on the set. It would have been a shame not to have shown this masterpiece. It was by far and away Brandon's finest performance. Every time I watch this movie, it affects me in a way that no other movie can. It blends a sensational soundtrack with an oustanding performance by Lee. I just can't help but think of Brandon Lee, and how he will never do another movie. One thing is for sure though, he left us a legacy that will never be forgotten.
