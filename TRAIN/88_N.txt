Cult classic just waiting
Sooooo bad it has cult classic written all over it. This movie will make a great drinking game if you go on every cliche and continuity error. It truly is the train wreck you can't stop watching. Having said that, I can't wait for the follow up, for the same reason! Be one of the first to watch before it gets recognised!!!!!
