love or dream?
The Story is very good and Damien is a wonderful Director, The Car Scene of the Opening is hugely successful. Emma and Ryan are acting really good, They can really practice the Impossible things in a few weeks, like play the piano and dancing, the Ending is sweet when they see each other and smile at us, it's a fantastic and wonderful movie of 2010s
