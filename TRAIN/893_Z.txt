Would've been better as a TV show
The more I watch this film, the more I like it, but the more frustrated I get at the fact that they tried to put such a complex plot into a 90-minute film.

The way the film was marketed, I thought that the four brothers of Ipswich were the protagonists, but when I watched it I found that they weren't - Caleb was. I didn't have a problem with this, but when you watch a film, expecting it to be about four warlocks an it ends up being about the classic, good vs. evil with the pursuit of a hot girl as the subplot, it can disappoint you.

The film had a lot of potential, but because of the way it was told it lacked what it needed to turn it into a great film, or even a great cult film.
