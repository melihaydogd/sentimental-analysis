Very great
The most magical part is without ever watching it three or fourth times, my mind is already stumbled with all the lyrics and lines. According to a reviewer (though I didn't know if it's original, I think it applies to everyone,) after years, when you if the songs again, you might not remember the lines, but you could always hynm it along. Most importantly, because of someone, the movie eventually has meanings to me too.
