Appeals to all ages!
I was fortunate enough to attend a preview in Denver. It is yet another Pixar that appeals to all. I attended with my 5 year old daughter, 8 year old son and two friends. We all really enjoyed this movie. The storyline was probably a bit over my daughter's head but she was drawn to the characters Dug the dog and Kevin the bird so it didn't make much difference. She was giggling through out the movie over their antics. My 8 year old son was drawn to the idea of a flying house and the adventurousness of the story as well as the characters. Certain parts of the story had my girlfriends and I getting choked up and teary eyed but that aspect of the story was over their head. There are a couple take aways from this movie depending on how old you are and not wanting to spoil it I will leave it at that. I highly recommend this movie! See it as a family if you can. It will make for wonderful discussion afterwords. My one regret was that my husband couldn't make it but we'll definitely see it again so he can. It's wonderful!
