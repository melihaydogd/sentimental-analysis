De Mornay & Banderas Set the Screen on Fire
Enjoyed the plot to this story and some very torrid scenes and horrible blood and gore all put into one package. Rebecca De Mornay,(Dr. Sarah Taylor),"Wedding Crashers",'05, played a shrink who was dealing with a mental case in a prison and also had a husband who was a doctor in the same hospital. One night on the way home from the hospital, she meets up with a young woman in the middle of the road in a very dark woods near a bridge. It is at this point in the picture that things really go crazy. As the story progresses, Sarah meets up with Antonio Banderas,(Tony Ramirez),"The Legend of Zorro",'05, who manages to hit on Sarah and gets a date and plenty more interesting torrid events. There are many twists and turns to this mystery tale and the ending of this film may greatly deceive you.
