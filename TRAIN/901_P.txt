Story of Hanuman (Hindu Monkey God)
Hanuman presents the first serious and truly professional Indian effort at animated movie making. Expecting Disney like finesse would be unjust for a beginner but the makers of Hanuman did an awesome job. One would get the glimpses of Disney's Lion king and Tarzan here and there in the style of animation.

The story is something which every Indian kid grows up with, its the story of monkey God Hanuman, son of God of wind Varun and Anjani, he is an incarnation of Lord Shiva. The narration assumes the viewers knowledge of the Hindu epic Ramayana, so for those who have not heard of Ramayana would find certain parts of the movie indecipherable.

Its a movie which kids are going to love and adults appreciate. Highly recommended for a full family fun. Highs: 1. Reasonably good quality animation. 2. Great music. 3. Does full justice to the theme. 4. Young Hanuman is super cute. Lows: 1. Presumes viewers' knowledge of the epic Ramayana. 2. Some more detail in the story telling would have been appreciated.
