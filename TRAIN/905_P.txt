A masterpiece
This is only kind of such movie made in Indian cinema. This movie truly replicates and speaks about mind and mindset of students in northern part of India (not in metros). The efforts put by director/writer Tigmanshu Dhulia can't be measured by just few awards. A lot of research (or say no research was required because every scene looks so natural) has been done behind each and every scene in the movie. Most of the actors in the movie are stage performers and they have given their best shots in the movie. No doubt this is the best movie of the best (?) actor in India after Kamal Hasan. Performance given by Jimmy Shergil and even Hrishita Bhatt is par above than so called superstars of Indian Hindi cinema. I recommend everyone to watch this movie at least once.
