Not bad, not good either
This movie is meh. It introduces some new characters but it was kind of boring. I was a fan of the series and the first movie was really great. This one had me falling asleep all the time. It is not what I expected at all. I would never rewatch it (like I did with the first movie) but it is not terrible. It is ok I guess..
