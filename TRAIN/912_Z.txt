Too many shockingly bad technical inaccuracies
Whilst Gone In Sixty seconds has a pretty fabulous cast and an acceptably punchy plot, I simply cannot forgive the glaring technical inaccuracies.

Now, I'm not the sort of person who would usually let a bit of "artistic licence" get in the way of my enjoyment of a motion picture, but this movie really stretched my tolerance for the portrayal of all things automotive.

1) None of the cars being stolen seemed to have any kind of steering column lock. Why is this? 2) The entry method to many of these exotic vehicles was laughably unrealistic.

3) Why did none of these (very expensive) cars have engine immobilisers? Basic Fords have such devices! 4) The ludicrous "Nitrous Oxide boost" scene, where Cage "jumps" a huge set of roadworks without trashing the car and/or killing himself was, for me, where this movie "jumped the shark" (no pun intended).

My friend and I watched this film, squinting and squirming all the way through at the chronic lack of attention to detail.

It just isn't good enough to rely on a good cast and shiny cars to carry an entire movie. Some kind of research into car theft might have been a good start... Hire an ex-car thief as a consultant, maybe.

It's not rocket science. A (potentially) good movie ruined by lazy direction and production.

4 stars (out of 10) from me, I'm afraid.
