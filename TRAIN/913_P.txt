Incredible performance, sensitive script
No matter your opinion on the subject, it's going to be difficult to get through You Don't Know Jack. It's understandable, though. A biopic of Dr. Jack Kevorkian and his work is bound to bother everyone, since the debate on euthanasia is intense and personal. If this television movie didn't make people cry, it wouldn't have been well-done. Al Pacino shines in the lead, completely camouflaging himself in the role and making audiences believe he really is Dr. Kevorkian. I'm sure even his greatest critics thought his performance was an inspired transformation, with none of his usual trademarks. If you're a fan of his acting, and you're in the mood for an extremely heavy film, rent this one and pick up a box of tissues.
With a strong supporting cast, including Susan Sarandon, John Goodman, Brenda Vaccaro, as well as an intelligent, thoughtful, sensitive script, this is one of those films that you watch once, think incredibly highly of, and never want to watch again. Just a warning, though, if you're staunchly anti-euthanasia, you're probably not going to like this movie. This is a film that celebrates the compassion, strength, and courage of Dr. Kevorkian.
Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to adult subject matter, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.
