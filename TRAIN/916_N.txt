3-8 of 10
I'm having a hard time rating this movie.I used to think that a movie is as good a it is remembered in a long term. This one is. Oh yeah, I will never forget it. In that term it is an 8.But the movie itself was lame, or actually kinda boring. I'm giving it a 3. Not even a butt naked Scarlett could raise i further.What could have saved the movie was the duration. They could have made it shorter, and wasted less of of my time. Shorter could even have made it more thrilling, seen in retro perspective.We land on 3. It will be remembered, but not for being anything interesting, but for being boring and lame - despite a fappening Johansson!
