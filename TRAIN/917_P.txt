What a joy to watch those faces, those beautifully photographed faces! I just keep clicking the pause button, only to admire that magnificent angelic face of Ingrid Bergman.
The story? Humphrey Bogart had a short affair with Ingrid Bergman. The 2 lovers parted abruptly and never saw each other again, untill they accidentally meet again in Casablanca during World War II. Will love blossom again?

Wanna see a real black and white classic romantic picture? Look no further than "Casablanca". I dont usually get easily excited about romantic movies, but "Casablance" is definitely something else and then some! What a powerful alluring romantic story, photographed in a way that is just breathtaking. I mean I just dont know the equal of it. Ingrid Bergman just looks so magnificently innocent and angelic, that I keep hitting the pause button almost every other 10 minutes when there is another still shot of her face to be admired. All the characters though are photographed in a way that is just to die for. What a terrific still shots.

All considered, there is not a lot of romance to be seen in this movie to be honest. That may sound strange, because I just labeled it as a terrific romantic movie, which it is, but "Casablance" starts out as a suspenseful cat and mouse game, between the german nazi's and a wanted resistance leader during World War II. The romance part stealthily sneaks into the movie later on and builds up in strength. And what strength of passion there is to be admired! Highly recommended. You got to at least give this classic a try, BUT be patient, because "Casablanca" starts out quite slow, so dont expect fireworks from the beginning, but it gets better and better near the end. What a glorious romantic end...
