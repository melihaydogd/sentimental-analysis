a lot of excess footage in this one
I liked Seven Samurai better than Rashomon (1950) by the same author, probably because it has a plot. The approach is similar, though, leading to more than a third of the movie being excess footage. A two-hour director's cut would most likely had been a watchable piece of cinema, but we'll never be able to verify my claim.The question remains why is this one of the best movies by one of the best directors of all times, apart from a lot people telling you so. Decades of repeating led this mantra to becoming an unquestionable truth, but i'd like to point out that critics might be wrong, after all.One of the more recent examples is Sofia Coppola's Somewhere (2010). You watch it and wonder why the accolades... but i guess the critics always need something to talk about, even when it puts some of the viewers to sleep.
