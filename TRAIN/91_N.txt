copy of monkey island
Basically this film has completely copied the famous 1990 computer game monkey island. In which the governors daughter is kidnapped by an undead pirate ghost and you have to rescue her. It even copies ideas like being stranded on an island and going crazy (like how herman toothrot was stranded on monkey island for so long and went mad). The idea of finding a ship and a crew. And it copies other things like not only it being set in the caribbean and having a voodoo lady, but the actual set and having to row through a swamp to get to the voodoo lady's shack, pirate towns made of broken ships and so many things just completely lifted from the game and lazily put into the film. The main villain of Pirates of the Caribbean also looks identical to the villain in Monkey Island. If you search for this on google, youtube, or anything, you can see how pirates of the caribbean just completely ripped off this game and is a really uninspired unoriginal film. The thing I did like about the film is probably Johnny Depp who seemed to play an alright quirky, silly pirate.
