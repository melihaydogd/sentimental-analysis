Good movie, bad political message
Let's put aside the obvious artistic achievements of this movie, thoroughly described in other comments, and look at the political side of it. Perhaps in other times, 5-10 years ago, this side would be not of any importance. Today however, when it's obvious that fascism is quickly gaining momentum in the U.S., followed by other countries like UK, this movie has too many parallels to the reality that can't be ignored. Looking from this angle, the movie plays very negative role, and its message plays for the evil party. It's actually 100% American way: people living under fascistic regime don't really need to do anything. Someone will promptly come over to the rescue, and he will crash the regime using few karate kicks and few explosions. No need to unite, no need to organize, to struggle, no need for revolutionary media, or any other effort or risk. In the right time, everyone will be given a mask to conveniently hide the identity, in case things go wrong; then, somehow, everyone will be on the street, without any visible organizational effort; then couple of explosions, and the regime will crash. Nice and easy solution without any real effort, so we can continue enjoying reality shows on the tube, while our troops kill Iraqis by thousands in our name and on our money. In the right time, the Superman will come over and clean our mess for us.
