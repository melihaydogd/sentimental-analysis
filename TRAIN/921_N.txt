Not worth seeing
Hey,this type of filming a movie sucks a big one.It's like watching a very bad home movie shot by the village idiot who couldn't hold the camera still.If they spent a 1.5 million on this piece of garbage they spent 1.4999999 too much.It's a huge waste of resources and money on a project that never should have seen the light of day.Here's a tip if your trying to show realism it''s not realistic for someone to be filming while zombies are chasing you and it's not very entertaining trying to watch a movie that is constantly bobbing up and down ,out of focus or grainy night vision.Please do use all a favor and quit making zombie movies or at least consult with someone who does know how to .(George Romero)
