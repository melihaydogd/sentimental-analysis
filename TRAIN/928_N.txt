Mad Max meets Water World meets Transformers
I was stunned. There was no real reason to use the title "Noah." I expected this movie to be an attempt to make a new and edgy adaptation of the biblical story of Noah that reflects current social conflicts. Its not that. Its just a CGI action movie with all the standard trappings and devices you expect in a recent-vintage CGI action movie. Nothing more. This movie is so typical I was embarrassed for the director. Noah has been reduced to just another GI Joe Ninja Fighter. Further, the premises are ridiculous and the continuity is highly-questionable. Supposedly Cain's descendants created an "industrial" (The movie's word)civilization and ravaged the earth. The landscapes are utterly barren. Then suddenly when its time to board the Ark, there are millions of creatures. No explanation. There are a few attempts at insight, but these have very little relevance to the Bible story. A waste of money and time.
