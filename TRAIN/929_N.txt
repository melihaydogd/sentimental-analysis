Awful ! Truly awful !
This flick is so bad, so awful, so poorly edited, written, acted you can't even laugh at the awfulness of it. With the line up of names the viewer is just dumb struck because this movie is just so awful.

Director David O. Russell and Writers Kristin Gore, Matthew Silverstein must have had nails hammered into their head to write and direct this embarrassment of bad movie. How does director Russell make a marvelous film like 'American Hustle' and then make this trash? Did he have a nail in his head? And Jake Gyllenhaal --- was he drugged or maybe threatened into this garbage?

If anyone wants to see a text book bad movie this is it! Their makeup is not consistent, the backgrounds are not consistent, the only consistency in this crap is the awfulness!
