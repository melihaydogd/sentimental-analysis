Rather dull
The inexplicable winner of the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film (equivalent of the Palme d'Or) at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival, The Go-Between (1970) is, to a degree, a love story. Romance films don't typically interest me unless there's some kind of twist to it. In this case, there appeared to be potential in telling it from the perspective of a young boy, supposedly a junior sorcerer, who acts as a messenger between two lovers (one being Julie Christie) and faces an ethical dilemma in assisting what's essentially adultery. Elements of class inequality are touched on.Alas, I don't feel the film quite realizes its potential. What relevance there is to the boy dabbling in "magic" may come across in the book, but in the film it seems immaterial and largely unexplored. The drama concerning the main plot rarely materializes. Aside from one scene where the boy is interrogated shrewdly by an old lady about inconsistencies as to who he's bringing messages to, we only have one small hissy fit thrown by Christie when the boy refuses to deliver a letter. What we're left with is mainly a slow, uneventful look at the English countryside, with most characters being polite but grey and dull, and hard to empathize with. Cannes had better than this.
