I think we all feel the same
Okay, we know the main problem with this show, casting. Queen Latifah is a talented lady. Amazing singer decent actor but this is just not a good fit. She is really trying to sell it but she is just not a believable in the lead tough guy roll. To bad, love the Denzel movies...
