Left something to be desired
I read most of the reviews that the other users left and I was expecting a lot more.  For a matter of fact the only movies that I had been highly anticipating this summer was; Matrix Reloaded, Bad Boys 2, LXG, SWAT and Pirates of the Caribbean.  Pirates was a let down.  Not in the sense that it sucked.  It didn't suck at all.  Johnny Depp was hilarious, and the visual effects were great. However it just never seemed to flow seamlessly to the point where I could become fully immersed in the film.  My suggestion; see the matinee or wait for DVD.
