Emotional Roller coaster!
Amazing movie! Loved every second of it!

I got goosebumps during certain parts of the movie. Amazing acting by Jim Carrey. It shows how ignorant some people can be and how they are missing out on life due to work and commitments. You should know when to say 'yes' and 'no'. So many lessons learned from it! One of my favorites from now onward!

The perspective at which the movie is looked at is plain amazing. The movie starts off with a depressed character who misses out on life a lot who eventually learns that life is not about staying indoors and living a loner life, its about making memories and keeping memories.

PERFECT when you are going through a rough time. Shows how exactly life should be lived!

I ALSO RECOMMEND WATCHING "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara ". It's a Hindi movie but it's just as beautiful as this movie.

Live your life guys! :)
