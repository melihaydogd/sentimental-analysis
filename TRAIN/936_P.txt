Horror without the blood and guts
If you're tired of the modern "horror" film that depends almost entirely upon the "shock value" of body dismemberment, demonic spirits, gallons of blood etc. etc.  -- give yourself the treat of watching this film.  The acting and character development heighten the effect.  There are even elements of compassion and mercy cleverly intertwined with the main theme -- how refreshing. The most unnerving and frightening stories hit us "too close to home" (ie - this could really happen!!).  There's no way to laugh this one off.
