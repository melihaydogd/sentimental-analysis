just wait for the DVD...
First and foremost I'd like to say that I went to see this because I'm a huge fan of the simpsons.

But like some fans I was disappointed.First they made Bart into a soft emo piece of s.h.i.t not the brat we used to know.Not enough emphasis on the other characters,such as Chief wiggum ,ralph and/so for it.

Second,there's barely any gags other than the ones seen on the trailers. The only reason I gave it 5 out of 10 is that they kept the goofy Homer we love otherwise...

In conclusion it's not a total flop but this should've came long ago,so my advice is just wait for the DVD which should come out for the holidays.
