Forgettable Harley Quinn Movie
The movie is not that bad, but to be honest...it's a movie about Harley, everyone else, pale in front of her.

I knew, that there will be feminism, but the whole movie is about feminism, which IMO is too much.

I would categorize the movie as DC's version of "Deadpool", but it won't be quite accurate. It must be seen to be understand.

There are some pretty creative approaches, some not so much. The story is not very impressive, but I think it's expected, nothing really special.

Black Mask got exactly one comicbook scene...kinda. Everything else about him was just...strange.

The action is probably the best part of the movie.

The music somehow fits into the overall atmosphere, there're 2-3 strikes.

Considering that I was expecting to be a total waste of time, I can say it was boring, but not disappointing as "Suicide Squad". I would say, that it's forgettable Harley Quinn movie at best.
