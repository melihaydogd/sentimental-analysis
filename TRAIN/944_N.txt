Why is anyone seeing this movie twice????????
I was so bored with the fighting at the end, it ruined the whole movie. And why does Johnny Depp sound like he's drunk, but hardly ever drinks? The special effects were nothing compared to other movies this summer.  I think I'll go see "Seabiscuit" again, so I can forget about this stinker.
