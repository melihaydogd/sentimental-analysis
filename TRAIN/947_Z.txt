Silly, Predictable But Entertains
Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) is a thirty-five years old bachelor man that still lives with his parents, Al (Terry Bradshaw) and Sue (Kathy Bates). Al and Sue hire the manipulative interventionist Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker) to play Tripp's girlfriend and seduce him, convincing Tripp to move out of their home. Paula and Tripp fall in love for each other, but Tripp's best friends Ace (Justin Bartha) and Demo (Bradley Cooper) accidentally find the truth about Paula and Demo discloses to Tripp, spoiling the plan and their relationship. When Tripp and Paula miss each other, their friends plot a scheme trying to arrange an encounter to fix the situation."Failure to Launch" is a silly and predictable romance, but entertains only because of the excellent cast. There is a great chemistry among the actors and actresses of this movie, keeping the interest of the viewer, in spite of a terrible and forgettable screenplay. The gorgeous Zooey Deschanel is the best in this flick performing Kit, the funny and complicated roommate of Paula. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Armações do Amor" ("Tricks of Love")
