Brainwashed
Well this film checked all the boxes. Evil Christian conservatives are Nazi perverts out to literally kill you if you are gay, muslim, journalist, writer or uppity woman. This film is based on a comic book but is actually more comical in it's contrived mactivist worldview. It ruined an otherwise entertaining film and it's no wonder Alan Moore wants nothing to do with it. Sad. Stupid. I know there are people who hate art, but can't they sabotage it with a little more subtlety? If you're making a movie, inject your ideas by all means but don't make us gag on it. Real modern governments and societies are imperfect systems with some good and some bad. Oh yeah, and you know it's okay to murder people cause they're Nazis. M'kay. The irony of this is that real Muslims and Christians have a lot in common, but anti-culture hacks and useful idiot actors and liberal arts majors want to divide and conquer. And they're doing a great job.
