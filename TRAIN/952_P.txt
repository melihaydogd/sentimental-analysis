Ethnic Cleansing on the screen
this movie is better than most WWII movies on the Nazis. It is up close and personal of dehumanizing evil. The acting is consistently good. Evil is not displayed with fangs and dripping blood. However, evil here is a real learning experience where the leaders justify there doing by dehumanizing everyone else.

the photography is a bit dark but so is the subject matter.

I had not seen the principle actress Zana Marjanovic before. She expresses her hopeless situation with hope in her eyes and motions in a way that carries her story to the end.

I remember this war when the Serbs shelled Sarajevo from the hills around the city and set snipers to kill people walking in the streets. You will not learn why these "soldiers" did it but you will see the banality of evil.
