Not as good as it could have been
Most of this movie, it seems, revolves around scenes in a garage where the lead actors tell the audience what they're going to do. The actual doing is then reduced to quick, almost montage-like scenes of the cars being stolen.

The film is essentially a car chase (at the end) padded out with lots of mostly unimportant dialogue and scenes (the rest of the movie). As an example, the pace of the movie grinds to a halt when, having found the keys for three Mercedes cars they need, the dog swallows them. There's then an entirely unfunny set of scenes involving ex-lax and waiting for the dog to crap out the keys. All the while you keep hoping the movie will continue but it doesn't until the dog poops up the keys.

The film is saved only by the final car chase, which rivals anything the Matrix series has provided, and which has the only half-way decent cinematic portrayal of what a compressed gas cylinder will do if the valve snaps off. Also a saving grace is Vinnie Jones - awful actor, but you can't help but like him anyway. His few scenes are worth looking out for.

And that's about it for Gi60S. Mostly dull with a few spots of brightness and a good car chase at the end.
