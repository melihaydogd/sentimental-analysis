A Fun Film for Fans!
This is a great treat for Inspector Gadget fans. Matthew Broderick makes a terrific Gadget. Michelle Trachtenberg does Penny justice, and they haven't updated her at all. She's just a very smart, cute little girl. There's no annoying concessions to the nineties. Brain doesn't talk--almost, but they've picked a very cunning-looking, adorable beagle for the part. Rupert Everett is suitably evil as Dr. Claw, and Joely Fisher portrays a believable love interest. The script honors the cartoon, and the gadgetry, most inventions from the source material, do not usurp the story or characterization which nicely portrays our heroes as simply nice people you'd love to have for your neighbors. Stay in your seat until the screen goes blank. Go-Go-Great!
