Worst movie I have ever seen!
I have just written one review, but this awful movie deserves one. This is absolutely incredible, but seems that lots of people liked it! I did not found anything funny in it, nor action, nor story, nor the way the story is told, nor the script that is horrible. This is a flat movie without any depth, the most superficial movie I have ever seen. You simply can't find any knowledge nor inspiration, nor entertainment in it. It is a great black hole, you'll only spend time watching it. There is no way to found something interesting in this movie. Except some seconds in a bowling scene, I can't find any interesting point of interest in this movie. And the hilarious part is that it was recommended to me by two friends of mine. There is something wrong in this world that I am not aware about.
