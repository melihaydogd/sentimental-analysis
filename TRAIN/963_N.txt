Parent's review - good for older kids and adults - bad for younger fans
Cars 2 is a jarring sequel to Cars. While the first is a very sweet movie that charms viewers of all ages with its "fish out of water" story that explores the value of true friendship - the sequel is an espionage movie, with nods to James Bond, The Man Who Knew Too Much etc. It's full of guns, bombs, explosions, fighting etc. The plot is very complicated and involves an environmental message about alternative fuels. Many cars are "killed". It was a terrific movie for my 11 year old son (who loved it) but it really scared my 4 year old son - whose favourite movie is Cars. The script and visuals are clever as always (up to Pixar standards) but this film's intended audience does not seem to include Cars' youngest fans. I was slightly disappointed on behalf of the many young kids at our screening who idolize these characters. The film is more in line with the action and violence of The Incredibles which I loved but will not be showing my youngest until he is older. Parents be warned - probably more appropriate for 8 or 9 yr old children and up. Final note, the Toy Story short at the beginning was delightful. (I hope they don't mess up Monsters Inc. next year)
