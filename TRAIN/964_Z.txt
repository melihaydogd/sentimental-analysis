This is so, so, so American
For the action parts it works, lots of shooting, fighting, blowing things up and actually refreshing seeing the White House as a setting in a action movie, last time I saw that was in Independence day and there it was just blow to pieces.It does take heavy fire and damage in this one as well, but it works very well and actually seems new and refreshing to see the bunker under neath and the hidden ways in the walls etc.The story seems a bit unrealistic, how could it really get to this, but in the scheme of things it works out. I like Mike Banning played by Gerard Butler, but actually the rest of the actors is nothing more then filling up empty space in the story. The do a good job and gets the story to stick together, but it is Mike Bannings goto attitude and fighting and shooting and just being a bad ass that is the best parts.The two hours fly by very rapidly, there is lots of action and fighting etc. and it is entertaining.
