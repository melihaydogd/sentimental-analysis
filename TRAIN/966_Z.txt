Ignore the over-sensitive reviewers, ignore the over-hyped praise.
This is a good film, but that's about it. If you were to read the reviews here, you'll see that people say it's the greatest film ever or one of the worst, most disgusting things ever that tests the limits of free expression and is a candidate for censorship.

It's neither.

Without spoiling the film - the story goes for too long. It's a 2 hour film, which is not very long for myself, but it felt very long and I just wanted it to end.

A lot of the action is pointless - there are some action scenes that advance the plot, but a lot of the action just exists to give us a sense of how terrible this place is. Once the initial message is made - we get it, loud and clear, the film continues to bludgeon us with the message over and over.

I'm not sensitive or easily offended. I've seen documentaries about places like this, but a lot of time is wasted building this world where it could be easily done in the background rather than the foreground.

The story is a bit thin - there are multiple mini-plots but the grand narrative is not really there.

The music and cinematography are interesting, a sort of 90's MTV music video popped up interpretation of a slum, but it doesn't get bonus points for that nor minus points for the "not taking the subject matter seriously" which some commenters complained about. The presentation style/chronology is strange and feels a little half-baked. It deals with multiple narratives but they lack a common starting point. When you meet a character, we're given a quick biographical montage/highlight reel to get us up to speed. This is done a few times, which takes you out of the film.

I liked the film, but only just and I wouldn't want to watch it again. Would not really recommend it to anyone.
