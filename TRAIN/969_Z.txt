Hey Vern, it's fast food!
Auggie Hamilton is all about making that fast buck. He's just been kicked out of college for a gambling and drinking party after being there for way longer than four years, as well as trying to sleep with the dean's daughter. What's he going to do now?So when he learns that his friend Samantha (Tracy Griffith, Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland) is about to sell her father's garage to make way for Wrangler Bob Bundy (Jim Varney, yes, the Ernest P. Worrell playing, Slinky Dog voicing Jim Varney. Trivia note: Blake Clark, who is also in this movie, was friends with Varney and took over the voice of Slinky after Varney's death) and his constantly growing burger empire.How do you defeat a megacorporation? Well, you go get some drugs that make people horny and put them in your burgers, that's how. And if you're wondering how they get that drug, one of the way they get women in bed is to sneak them into a lab where men suffer from non-stop erections. The girls see all these bald-headed yogurt slingers and the next thing you know, they're in bed with the guys. Because you know - that's totally how romance works. Movies like this are why I didn't get laid until I was 24.How does the new fast food place get successful? Well, beyond the date rape drugs in the special sauce, they also cater a fancy preppie sorority bash been thrown by Mary Beth Bensen, who is played by the same person who played the grown-up Angela in Sleepaway Camp II and Sleepaway Camp III. That's Pamela Springsteen and yes, she's the Boss's sister.Stick around - Traci Lords also shows up as an industrial spy, sent by Wrangler Bob to ruin our heroes. And oh yeah - the judge of their big case is played Kevin McCarthy from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Michael J. Pollard shows up, too.This isn't a movie you'd be proud to talk about with anyone, but who cares? Varney is great, Traci Lords is Traci Lords and burgers cause people to get laid. You could do much worse.
