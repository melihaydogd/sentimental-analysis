inspiring, and definitely worth your time
Honestly, i didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as i did. it was a bit graphic at parts but still ended up being a beautiful, inspiring movie. i loved the fact that it showed us many aspects of real life and politics, as well as a diverse cast! i ALSO loved the fact that it was sad, funny, happy, adventurous and political, all rolled into one movie! currently, i'm working on becoming vegetarian thanks to its motivational message! this movie was very moving and you will not regret watching it!
