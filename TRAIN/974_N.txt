Predictable: there's only so many ways we can put a twist on a Christmas movie.
The art style feels very inspired by its predecessors. However, unlike classics like the Nightmare Before Christmas and Krysar, every villager is flat and one dimensional in their motivations. Have to gag at the one female character being used as just a romantic interest at the end. As though the main character had "earned" her. Would a platonic friendship be not considered a happy ending? Would suggest Tokyo Godfathers or Arthur Christmas if you want a refreshing take on Christmas animation
