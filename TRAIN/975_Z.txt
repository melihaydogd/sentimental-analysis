Not nearly as bad as expected. Adults can stand it, kids will love it. Aykroyd was perfect choice. I say B-, my kids say A.
An evil mayor wants to shut down Jellystone Park for his personal gain. Ranger Smith and Yogi come up with a plan to save the park. Going in I was expecting pretty much one of the lamest movies of the year. It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. Although this is geared toward kids and is extremely predictable it does have enough funny parts in it to keep adults entertained (an 80 min run-time helps). Much like "Garfield" the voice of Yogi (Aykroyd) is a strange choice at first, but after hearing it you can't think of anyone else doing the voice. As much as I don't want to say it Timberlake, as the voice of Boo-Boo, is actually a really good choice too. Adults will be able to stand most of it, kids will love it. I say B-, my kids say A.
Would I watch again? - I wouldn't, my kids did.
