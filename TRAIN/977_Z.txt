Visually Stunning - but also ponderous, plodding and dull
I can't remember the last time I watched such a thoroughly stunning visual treat on a big screen. I think this is possibly the most authentic realisation of a graphic novel I've seen. Each scene is framed like a panel in a comic, and the viewer is allowed ample time to drink in the superb visual construction of the piece.

Sadly, the time this takes makes for a movie far too long, with not enough actually happening, to be enjoyed. The main plot line is fairly thin, and is stretched to the point that I actually forgot about it half way through. The dialogue (Rorschach aside)lacks sparkle, as do the performances (again Rorschach aside - Jackie Earle Haley is to be commended for his performance), whilst the extensive flashbacks used throughout only serve to disrupt the narrative flow and make for an often confusing viewing experience. There's enough here to make me want to revisit the book, but I doubt it will make it to the DVD collection. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this - but unfortunately I was so bored by the end of it that I just wanted to leave. How disappointing.
