Hollywood Cheese
The once great Ridley Scott continues to disappoint in a film for Matt Damon enthusiasts who enjoy crowd-pleasing silly dialogue & gooey, touching moments with accompanying music that helps you know when you're supposed to feel something. Bring him home? Eh...seems like a lot of work & I'm sure in reality NASA wouldn't bother. And neither should you.
