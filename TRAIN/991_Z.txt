10/10 Comedy, 4/10 Action, 1/10 Intelligence
Let's give this movie some credit. Morgan Freeman could make Pluto Nash look like a good movie if he wanted. His presence contributed something. It was a shame that his character, however, did not.The villain was cool. The gun fights were cool. The hand-to-hand combat was PATHETIC. It all amounted to close up shots of the waist, artfully avoiding the need for choreography. Most combat was resolved with a "Sock!" punch of some kind. It was so dated, it was like watching a fight scene in the original Star Trek series, only without the surrounding plot or character interaction.So, cool guns, cool explosions, and some watchable stock characters.Here we get to the best part of the movie. It was hilarious. I'm sure people in the audience thought the big American accent guy at the front of the cinema must have found all the flag waving (at an obvious point that everyone knew was coming, just to avoid spoilers) quite evocative, because I literally had to bite my fingers until the pain was overwhelming to avoid bursting into laughter. I'm laughing now just thinking about it. By the movie's end, I was leaning forwards with my eyes watering and my fingers in my mouth, my girlfriend holding onto me for moral support, and when the credits finally rolled I leaned my head back and laughed for a full minute. I am glad I watched this movie.Here's the bad part. If you're looking for something with a brain, run. Run fast, far, and never ask a patriotic American for their opinion. You will be offended in every way. I'm not slagging off patriotism, or America, but if you're dumb enough to accept the WAY they do it in this movie, take your 2-digit IQ back to the trailer park and please, please get your ilk out of Hollywood while you're at it.
