One episode gave Sam and Bucky more development in 45 mins than in 6 movies
As of writing this there has only been 1 episode released, but I feel confident in saying that this show could very well be one of the best MCU projects ever!The sheer fact that this one episode has made Sam and Bucky both feel like less of the sidekick character or the cool action character. We see a sophisticated story line with Bucky coming to terms with his past and Sams family.I thought this show would be carried by its action but if the other 5 eps are anything like this, it will be completely character driven and purely amazing.This will definitely be better than WandaVision...
