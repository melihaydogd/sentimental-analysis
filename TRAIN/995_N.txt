Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever Made.
This movie should never have been made. Yuck. If you like this movie, you're probably twelve and female and have no sense of what art and film is or should be, and probably shouldn't be watching movies in the first place. Flat story based on even flatter subject-matter. I don't know what is worse, that this film ever got made or that Hollywood continues to find reasons to make films about *dancing*. Let's just pretend that the story was good, the dialog anything other than flat, the direction and photography somehow original...it wouldn't matter. *Dancing* has to be the least-compelling base subject matter for any story or film. But don't worry, if if the whole idea of dancing doesn't make you want to vomit, the flat acting, directing, and dialog will, I assure you. Unless you are literally a twelve-year old girl, or just have yet to mentally mature beyond that, I think you'll agree. And if you are, then you're opinion DOES NOT MATTER!
