Dissapointed
I saw "The Matrix" & "Matrix Reloaded" in the big screen twice. I liked them very much and waited for "Matrix Revolutions" but now that i saw the last part of the trilogy i 'm dissapointed. The peace is not going to last long.People need to get out of Zion and machines need power.Neo's powers are incomprehensible (there is no explanation).Characters like Merrovigian,Percephone,Sati and her parents are only exist to fill up the movie. The attack in Zion was great.
