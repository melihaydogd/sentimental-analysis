What a film..
a gripping story, with beautiful shots, and a direction of master himself. a story that takes you to the lane of past and force you to feel that pain and go through their journey. that's the beauty of cinema.. loved it. everything was looking so good, whether acting, music, sound, cinematography, editing. everything was so fantastic. specially the colors,and how they use the contrast of that red blazer, to show the authenticity and pain of those people, the helplessness of those. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected.
