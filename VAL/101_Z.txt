They clearly ran out of ideas after two seasons
The first two seasons (and the season 3 premiere) were incredible. It was sci-fi with fart jokes and somehow that&#39;s an amazing combo. However, season 3 was horrible and season 4 is off to an awful start. Somehow, all of the sci-fi aspects are gone and everything has been replaced with action and violence. I&#39;m not against those things, but that&#39;s the most simplistic form of entertainment and quite frankly, if I was looking for that, I&#39;d look for better versions of it than this. As it is, I have a hard time watching these episodes now but somehow feel obligated to do so because I bought them. My advice? Watch seasons 1 and 2 and pretend that it ended there because it&#39;s just gotten stupid and mindless.
