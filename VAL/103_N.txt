very strange indeed
From time to time in small pieces, I managed to finish the 2005 Pride and Prejudice. I am no expert of Jane Austen, nor of the English Regency period, but still I can be quite disappointed by this adaption.  Compared to the very impressive Liz by Jennifer Ehle, whom I already deem as an idol, Keira Knightley is far lack of beauty and charm. I cannot stand her grimaces and grins, which frequently happened, and made such an exhibition of Liz. Mr. Darcy is very unconvincing, and many other characters, such Mr. Bennet, Mr. Colins, are also very strangely depicted. The only merit might be the color and the scene, but that can hardly help. I still prefer simpler and lighter colors for such an movie. After all, if Liz is failed, the movie is failed.  I cannot help singing praises again for the 1995 BBC version. Not only Liz and Darcy, every other character were so vividly presented. Especially I would mention Mr. Colins, because his every scene amused or disgusted me so much that I started a very harsh criticism on greasy man of his kind to my friend for half an hour. Then I realised what an art it is for the actor to achieve such an effect. In comparison, the 2005 Mr. Colins is unfortunately very dull and empty, and cannot be understood or connected to any real character in life.  I have been very cruel, but I cannot be milder after the 1995 P&P, which really brought the novel to life!
