Most boring movie I've seen in a long time
My god, this was a boring film. Two hours and 20 minutes that seemed more like six hours. There was way too much talk, interwoven plot lines that made little sense and a paucity of any kind of action until the very end. As for a political statement, that the government should be afraid of the people instead of the other way around: Fine, blow up Parliament but don't take so freakin' long to do it. If I had been alone, I would have walked out before it was half over; as it turns out my companion would have joined me but we both ended up suffering. How does anyone sit down and watch the final cut of a movie as bad as this and say to themselves, "This is it. It's good to go." V was boring, Natalie Portman unconvincing as the girl who falls in love with the mystery man behind the mask. And what was all that about the letters written on toilet paper? I probably just wasn't paying attention. I'd taken my glasses off long before that since I really didn't care what was going on. Bad movie! on. Bad movie!
