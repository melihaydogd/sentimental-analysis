The red headed step child of the series
This films functions far better as a predictor of the terrible prequels than as a sequel of the first two films. Several factors-the Ewoks are the lest of it-work to make this film exceptionally weak. It adheres too closely to repeating A New Hope ala Beowulf. The incest being retroactively added to Empire does not help. Worse the film is split into distinct sections that don't function as a story overall. This film is really two stories-the rescue of Han and Death Star 2.0. Neither one is given proper to time breath and they don't gel together.Nonetheless, the core of the film is solid. Luke's arch is brought to a satisfactory close and the various characters are given proper send offs. Even the final battle is rather serviceable despite the repeat from A New Hope. This brings the first set of films to a proper ending.This film is the most damaged by the special edition. All of the added material weakens the material and adding a "noooooo" to a critical moment is so artless that it nearly destroys the entire climax and thus story.
