Don't Fall for the Hype
This film serves as a perfect testimony to just how far the current superhero obsession has run amok into completely asinine territory. Deadpool is arguably the most despicable character ever to have been passed off as a hero. Aside from this fact, all of the hoopla from the fan boys saying that this was an edgy film couldn't be more wrong. Throwing vulgar language into the dialogue doesn't make for an edgy film, but it does make for a film that is a phony try-hard. At the end of the day, this film follows the exact same formula as any other contrived superhero film, regardless of what the hype surrounding it might say. This level of self-congratulation attempting to pass itself off as clever is offensive to any viewer who is smart enough to see what's going on. Don't fall for it. This film isn't nearly as smart or witty as it thinks it is.
