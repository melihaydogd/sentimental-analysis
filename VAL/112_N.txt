utter lameness
It's just so typical of dumb asses on the IMDb to overrate this tired, badly written piece of nonsense. The overuse of bad explanatory speeches/ dialogue combined with its simplistic didacticism really grated - the film offered a cheesy crash course in political subversion/ rebellion for cretins. The love story was irrelevant, sentimental and completely uniteresting because the charcterisation was so lame - princess amrilla's character was nothing more subtle than the pretty scared girlie who grows a political conscience and a bit of courage. The direction and editing were hackneyed, dull and predictable. The photography was stunningly flat and badly framed, just boring -take the shot of the English people watching telly - it was like a particularly tedious Kodak moment from a family album.
