Blade Runner. All style, no substance.
An exercise in graphic design. A movie that wanted to speak to the human condition, but choosing to do so by avoiding all things human. There's lighting, and costumes, and set design to burn, but all the actors have been forbidden to act. One cardinal rule has been adhered to, "show no emotion". In the future, it rains all the time and we've all become automatons, sheesh, would somebody mind writing a movie for this trailer?
