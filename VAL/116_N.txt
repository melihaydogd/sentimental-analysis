As boring as it can gets
The film is dull, boring and slow, no character is able to convey any emotion at all. We can't hardly hear Marion Cotillard when she speaks, she is one of my favourite actress but she disgusted me in this role. Emil/Orlando who is called pivotal is as interesting as a dead oyster and the quarrel between him and his cousin Bruno is extremely weak borderlining ridiculousness and neither does it help to keep the audience interested. Neither makes Phoenix's character sense and it is hardly believable I am afraid but this film was absolutely unnecessary with a highly foreseeable plot. Settings and costumes is the only acceptable part of the film and Carusso singing in Ellis Island was the only moment when I felt a certain emotion I not recommend it to anyone and I am sorry for anyone that spent his money in such a heartless and spiritless film. We are force to write ten lines on reviewing films but I am finding hard to have much more to say.
