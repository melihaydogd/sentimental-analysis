The most boring movie for 2015
Under zero emotions! The story supposed to be great but it wasn't. That drama was not a drama but just some pieces of stories that this director tried to joined by force and to give a meaning during its way. Most of the biggest troubles was that camera that never stopped shaking and zooming in and out and moving up and down with no sense even in the most quiet portrait. There is no need to play with moving camera in senseless way to make the story more dramatic. Big disappointing even in some characters there. Not professional. Pretending! I would ask to this director to give me back the time i spent to watch his bullshit and maybe to tell to him how he can do this movie in more positive way.
