The movie didn't make me cry. But the movie made me feel a sad goodbye. With the pursuit of the perfect dream
In the first time I saw this movie poster in the cinema near my house. I didn't want to watch it much. But after I heard the news that this movie got many academy awards and many golden globe awards. I want to watch it. Until Netflix Thailand put this movie. I have watch it and I love it very much. I like the first scene that all of the cast singing another day of the son. The Choreography of the casts is perfect. Someone in the crowd is also perfect. I love the color of the dress and the emotion of the cast. And the scene that I like the most is the ending. Like that I wrote in the heading. " This scene didn't make me cry. But this scene made me feel a sad goodbye. With the pursuit of the perfect dream"
