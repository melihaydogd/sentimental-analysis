I still don't get it
People sure love this movie.  I have a friend who says that it&#39;s good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming.  Well yeah, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; does push the envelope - but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?<br/><br/>My ex-girlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy.  If that were true, the violence would be entirely justified, because it would help elevate &quot;Reservior Dogs&quot; to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas, none of the characters is particularly noble; they start off as low-lifes and have nowhere to fall.  So, that defense doesn&#39;t seem to work either.<br/><br/>In short, people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece.  But even the best parts - such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant - seem artificial and engineered.  Tarantino is ripping off older, better films and directors wholesale.  There are shades of &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot; here, and there&#39;s also a dash of &quot;The Omen&quot; at the end.  Hitchcock, Frankenheimer, and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before, and they did it better.  No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies, but he was not much of an innovator, and I don&#39;t think that his super-cool style has stood even the shortest test of time; he has, after all, practically dropped off the face of the earth.
