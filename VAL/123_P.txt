Bleak neo-noir
Con artists (here referred to as grifters) are a popular character type in films. This is somewhat logical as film-making itself is something of a con: like any mark, the viewer has to react a certain way for the scheme/plot to work. The major difference between The Grifters and other films about con artists is the lack of a regular mark: every major character in the film is a grifter and each one always seems to have some plan to manipulate the others while simultaneously maintaining a state of hyper-vigilance to avoid becoming a victim himself. This means that the viewer is also hyper-vigilant and always expecting some complicated scheme to suddenly fall into place. The great part of this film is that this never happens: the fact is that none of these people really has a big plan. Instead they all just distrust each other and steadily become miserable even though they ought to be comforting each other, especially since two of the three main characters are blood relatives. What we're left with is one of the darkest of all neo-noirs. Ultimately the film manages to shock the viewer because the expected deus ex machina experience that ties everything together in a neatly arranged package of destiny fulfillment and narrative closure isn't only absent but altogether unformed because the world of this film is one ruled by the chaos of chance.The film is also impeccable from a technical standpoint: the visuals are carried off really well and the acting is spot on.
