Magical and Whimsical Filmmaking
This is a fabulous film in so many respects. It all starts with that spectacular opening and there are so many memorable scenes throughout, with the now iconic night time scene above the "city of stars" that adorns the film poster a particular highlight. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are just perfect. Add to that a great score, wonderful cinematography and a sublime ending and it all amounts to one of the best and most original movies of the last 10 years that seems to get better with every viewing.
