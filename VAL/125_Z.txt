Triple A logic error popcorn cinema
Captain America The Winter Soldier is supposed to be a AAA Hollywood movie. Apparently this means that it only needs explosions to be good. If you dare to demand a logical consistent story you will be unsatisfied. The acting is good, the explosions are just the same as in every other marvel movie. The story is very obvious and the supposedly surprising changes are foreseeable by a 10 year old. My biggest problem is the logical inconsistency. In the following a few examples: SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The propulsion of Director Furys car is destroyed by an explosion, and the damage is fixed by restarting the PC of the car. highly impossible no matter the technological level.

A broken wrist is healed by antibiotics, during a fighting scene. Even so this might be useful in the long term healing of the wrist, but during a gunfight it's probably not the most important thing to do.

Director Furys car has a stationary gun inside the vehicle. This gun safes the live of Fury, however it doesn't explain why it even exists. This gun can only be used to attack people inside the car, why is it stationary? This scenes shows that many gadgets the heroes used were designed by the writes exactly for this one scene, instead they should've tried to create gadgets which might be realistic, and then change the scenes so that the gadgets make a sense, not vice versa.

Fury escapes heavily injured through a hole in the ground. The bad guy super soldier is maybe 2 seconds behind him and doesn't hunt him down by following him into the hole. Why? He is faster, younger and healthier, why not try to follow him? Surely Fury wouldn't have been able to outrun him if the Winter solider would have tried.

The big airships have a very important PC core. This core is extremely important, still it is positioned at the bottom of the airship and protected by glass. They chose to position the most important part of the airship at the least defendable and least protected position. wtf? why?
