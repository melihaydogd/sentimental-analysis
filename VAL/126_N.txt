Sometimes, we all just don't agree.
Last week, I had seen "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.nIn the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.First I thought, I might not be a big "prison" entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is "Birdman of Alcatraz" (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with "The Green Mile" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's "Oz" which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, "Reservoir Dogs" is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", I find myself here at "The Shawshank Redemption", and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing.
