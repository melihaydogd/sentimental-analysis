Cute ode to retro-futurism
Even though I enjoyed the film and its old-fashion perspective on futurism I am not sure I enjoyed some aspects of the movie. Soundtrack was one of my main points of frustration for me. It is too "metallic" (which was the point) and agressive and added very little to story. I enjoyed the unique story though as well as some amazing acting! I give it a 7 purely because of the film's soundtrack.
