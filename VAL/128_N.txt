Convoluted mess without entertainment value.
Love them or hate them, Disney movies have always had one thing in common: they tried to transport you into a magical world populated with interesting, colorful characters.

"Inside Out' foregoes that tradition and seems to be trying to explain basic principles of psychology to young audiences. The result is a mess: not only is it not 'fun', it's also constantly shoehorning painful exposition mechanism by having characters explain what's on screen.

I just don't see kids below 10 enjoying this in the least. And as an adult, there are better ways to learn about psychology than watching an animated film.

Utterly bizarre.
