an insulting waste of 97 minutes of my life...
Frankly as a nerd i'm quite offended by this ridiculously predictable portrayal of a nerds life, it has just about every boring clich√© that has become overused by years of declining media values such as geeks and nerds are fat, socially awkward, angry and in need of every bodies pity, whilst in most cases this may be true, it was unnecessary to throw it in the viewers face at every turn. I would absolutely NOT recommend this insulting pile of garbage to anyone other than maybe a schoolyard bully wanting to laugh at all the childish jokes that have ever been thought up to hurt nerds and geeks. I watched this movie because i was highly bored and the tag-line stood out, it failed to even alleviate the boredom slightly.
