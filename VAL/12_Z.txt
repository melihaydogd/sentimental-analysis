a Classic
This picture takes the happily-ever-after myth of Hollywood stardom and shatters it for good. When talking pictures became the standard virtually overnight, the big studios turned their collective backs on most of the silent icons that had helped build them. This film offers a frequently sympathetic view of the descent of one of these icons into despair and madness - and for silent film buffs, offers a rare opportunity to see the likes of Anna Q. Nilsson and Buster Keaton in speaking cameos. This film greatly pushes the limits during a time where the code ruled over Hollywood. A Real trend setter
