Err... It's alright, but Matrix it is not.
I'll be short. "Reloaded" was horrible. "Revolutions" is a logical continuation of "Reloaded". Lot's of PC-game style CGI, zero acting, minimal plot with plenty of holes... It's an action flick, just like any other mediocre Sci-Fi movie you've seen before. If you expect a worthy conclusion for this trilogy - lower your expectations. It's simply the wrong movie.
