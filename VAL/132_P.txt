The Least Best Movie of the Original Trilogy
While this is probably my least favorite of the original trilogy, it was still a pretty good movie. John William's score was obviously amazing, all of the characters were very well written, and were still enjoyable and likeable, and the ending was fantastic. The only thing about this movie is that it follows two of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time...7.8/10.
