"zany madcap humour"
Arthur, King of the Britons, who doesn't have a horse and instead bangs coconuts together to fool his subjects into thinking he has, decides to amass a rag-bag of knights to his Round Table - the daredevil Lancelot, the pure Galahad, the foolish Bedevere, the cowardly Robin. God (in wonderful cartoon form) then challenges him to find the Holy Grail - cue the split stories as each knight has their own 'adventure' whilst trying to locate the precious relic.

This being Python it is obviously going to be very silly. The Knights Who Say 'Ni!' are one of the highlights, as is the exceptionally camp prince (Terry Jones) who is in a tall tower waiting to be rescued, the killer bunny rabbit, and Sir Robin's band of minstrels. Graham Chapman plays Arthur in a quasi-Shakespearean fashion which at least makes the character memorable, and there are neat cameos from the likes of Connie Booth and Carol Cleveland, both honorary Pythons from the BBC TV series.

It isn't a perfect movie and isn't consistently funny - however as a send-up of historical epics it does the job very well.
