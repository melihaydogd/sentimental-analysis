Really mediocre movie!
I went in expecting a knockout of a horror movie ...with a bit of humor in it according to the description and some word of mouth reviews. ...I barely made it through the entire movie. Really bad writing, directing and acting, although I like the two leads. It was nothing better than a mid-range episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits; the comedy fell just as flat as the story for me ...it came off as completely forced; not funny at all.
