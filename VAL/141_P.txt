Charming tale for the kiddies
I want to say that G Force was much better than I had anticipated, and I am surprised by the many negative reviews. Clearly aimed at the juvenile portion of the market, this grandfather had a delightful time attending with his 6 year old grandson. The special effects, even in 2-D, were extraordinary. I still am not sure what exactly I saw--was it animation, computer generated effects, live action animals? The effects were that good! The story line was very simple, but what do you expect in a children's story? The climax near the end with the most action was a bit over the top--hint: transformers ripoff--but it was part of a cute and unexpected twist in the story line which went along with the sheer fiction nature of the whole tale. All in all, I don't think this over-60 year old could have enjoyed a film for the elementary set any more.
