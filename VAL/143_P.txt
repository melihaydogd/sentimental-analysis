The problem isn't the film, it's you.
You know what the problem is? You expect all the wrong things from the wrong places. You yearn mindless action when it gives you profundity, you expect hapless simplicity when it gives you intellectual complexity. And you expect to be spoon-fed when it wants you to ponder.

Do not let expectations rule your decisions. This isn't a film for the meagre minds who expect to clap their cymbals in harmony with some of the drivel that are shown on today's silver screen. If it is your heart felt opinion that The Avengers deserves an Oscar, then don't bother watching this film.

Birdman is a heavily nuanced yet eloquent visual art form. It is different. And it requires the audience to flow with the unconventional rhythm of the film rather than expect rigid logic and conventional storytelling. We are allowed to explore the character's purlieu while empathising with his inner mediocrity. It aims to express the level of malaise one experiences when he fails to achieve what he feels he deserves. The film may not answer all the questions it creates, but that's the beauty of it.

Watch it without petty expectations, and appreciate it for what it is. A cinematic ballet; an experience. However, not everyone can comprehend it. The thing is, if you think that it's beyond you as to why this film is so critically acclaimed, then it probably is and there might be a problem. While it's certainly not the film's.
