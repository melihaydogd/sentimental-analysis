Should be renamed the Zac Bagans show
I used to really love this show, but you can tell that it has became all about Zac, as the main host I find it shocking that he stears clear of all the solitary experiments. He also talks over the other 3 hosts on the show. The best thing they could do is walk away from Zac and start their own show. Well done Nick for having the courage to do this. Zac you really have become a wannabe and a fake!! Learn from your mistakes before it's to late
