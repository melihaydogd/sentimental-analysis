Mediocre
Let's be honest, it's a fairly mediocre movie. Entertaining, I'll grant you, but profound? No way. Not much here in terms of innovative or even creative film-making either.Is it one of the most popular films of all time? Probably. At least of recent time.nIs it the greatest film ever made? Don't make me laugh.That said, I'm glad people can enjoy this movie. I won't watch it again, but I don't exactly regret it.
