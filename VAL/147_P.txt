Incredible movie!
I don't get the people giving lower than a 7-star rating and nagging about plot holes and the ending.

It's a movie that requires a lot of thought since EVERYTHING represents something. I even saw one review that said "how did they know that the platform is not reaching the ceiling at the top floor -it could kill them-" Well, OF COURSE the platform cant bang on the ceiling since someone has to place the buffet there. What's the point of a platform banging on the freaking ceiling?! After that, it s a REPRESENTATION. You can't interpret this movie literally. Everything is an Allegory! Please, read some reviews here that have the interpretation of every character and scene. You will immediately think.. wow! It will be really helpful.

I wish it was a serie that I could watch everyday. Really interesting movie, definitely recommending it!
