One of the better Best Pictures
This is a movie that grows on you the more times you watch it. The movie is quite slowly paced, so anybody looking for non stop action should look elsewhere. Anybody looking for a nicely played film spiced with well rounded characterisation and moments of tension will be well rewarded.
A couple of cowboys turn on the ladies at the local brothel. Not happy with the "punishment" handed out by Little Bill (Hackman) the ladies band together and offer a reward for slaying the cowboys. Little Bill in turn decides to tighten up on the cowboys who try to claim the reward including English Bob (Harris) and Bill Munny (Eastwood). All the leads put in fine performances with the possible exception of Morgan Freeman who seems to be freewheeling. 8/10
