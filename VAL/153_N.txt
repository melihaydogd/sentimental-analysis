Not so good
I can see why certain ppl would like this movie. But I've been watching it myself for several years now & it's just not for me. I think it's cheesy & just not funny. Apart from the creepy scenes with the young mom hitting on her future son, there's a huge plot hole I've noticed for many years. Why wouldn't his adult parents remember that their son looks identical to the kid from both their pasts? It's a dumb movie, made for a "certain" group of ppl.
