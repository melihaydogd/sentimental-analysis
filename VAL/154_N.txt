Awful script with very nice view
Poor characters, clichï¿½ story, terrible dialogue. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my good time.

I guess cinema fans find it really hard to not like Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel, especially when they are this old and look very wise, sagelike.

I guess everybody has a similar expectancy when it is a movie about old age and youth and life... it has to have some wisdom. And the film tries to fulfill this, poorly. It is full of one-phrase self- help wisdom more apt for twitter than for a work of art. Dialogues like: "when you are young everything seems so close (looking through the telescope) that is the future... when you are old everything seems far (looking through the other side of the telescope) that is the past..."

It doesn't even make any sense. And the movie is full of this. Most of the dialogue is either that or just pure nonsense. Sounds very wise at first and when you think about it a minute it's total bull.

Yes Michael Caine can make a scene come alive, but there is no real character development apart from some very worn cliches like the unattached musician who can't relate to the world (I do music because music doesn't need words, just emotions, I don't understand the world, I understand music) And there is no development to his desicions he makes and the changes he goes through. But after all he is an actor and doesn't make a difference how good is and actor if the story is a non-story.

And all the supporting characters... they don't support the story. There is Maradona (obviously) staying at the hotel and he has quite long scenes. I don't see what he has to do with anything. But even the more complex characters like the movie star staying at the hotel, doesn't support the story. Just comes in, blurts out some self-help wisdom and goes out. Same as the "miss universe" that comes in saying "she loves robot movies" and turns into a psychoanalyst in 20 seconds and blurts out some more self-help and out she goes only to come back to expose her entire body naked some minutes later.

I actually thought of giving it a 4 out of 10 just out of respect for the very good acting... but then again, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except to give an example of bad dialogue writing and still it would be a waste of time.
