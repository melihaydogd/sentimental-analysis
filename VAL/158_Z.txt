Philosophy, special Effects and great actors, not it's not "STAR WARS" !
Warning: Spoilers
---Spoilers Ahead---

Matrix is unique for one thing, its phisophy. The Matrix tells us that we live in an artifial world and nothing is what it seems... The real world is too terrifying to live in and the people who actually live in it have to fight against machines. And here we are waiting for the chosen one who is a hacker and believes there is something more to see, to explore. After being released from the artificial world by taking a... pill( also watch "Trainspotting") and choosing a real life (here are is a reference to a greek hero, Hercules, who did the exact same thing, he chose the hard way! The only difference is that he didn't take a pill!), our Character Neo fights back not knowing if he is the chosen one or not! And wins the first battle(out of 3, coming up "The Matrix Reloaded") against the EVIL machines.

So do we, who would expect such a script? Although there are plenty of plot holes, Matrix has such an impressivly good story that you just ignore them because the script makes you think they are there for a reason! Although the characters are not developed as much as someone would like(something smells like a franchise) but they give you a glimpse of their personality, that's why you get curious abou their future. Matrix is something more that just a fairy-tale, it is a movie with brain, it is the true story of our world. Because we live in an Artificial World ! We are ruled by machines and those who fight the system we call them terrorists!

the Sequels won't say new stuff, they'll just bring up the rest of the story, which is not that interesting! We all now it's going to have a happy ending, we all now that the main attraction is what the special effects going to look like? What music are they going to use? Is there any karate( because of Jet-Lee's appearence) Matrix-styled in it? Any special cameos? Any new philosophy> nah, i don't think so.

Another thing abou the Matrix is stylish direction, who would expect all these bullet-time shots, the John-Woo shots, the marvellous special effects! The Helicopter sequence(Slash, Bang!), the touch-the-mirror sequence, the fight in the end(Crash, Boom!). The flying sequence(you know it has used in aaah] Scary Movie and [woow!] Shrek!) ofcourse is the most memorable though!

One question: I heard that the upcoming Star Wars is going to be NC-17 rated! Is it true? My true question is Matrix going to be that cold again or the in-love characters will move a step forward ?

P.S, Why every new movie is borrowing Matrix sequences? Haven't they seen T2 or any of the DIE HARD'S??? JEEEZ!
