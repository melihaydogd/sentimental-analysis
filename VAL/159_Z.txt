Cheap thrills
Just to be clear, I believe First Blood to be an absolute classic, followed by the enjoyable popcorn flick sequels.<br/><br/>This film however plays on some VERY deep and dark themes with all the finesse of a drunk orangutan firing a machine gun on full auto, purely as a cheap setup for a grotesque final act for Rambo to dish out his flavour of a sadistic Home Alone fantasy.<br/><br/>An altogether unnecessary film which has more in common with horror films Saw &amp; Hostel than it does with any classic action franchise.<br/><br/>Let&#39;s hope Sly stops before releasing Rambo: Geriatric Blood.
