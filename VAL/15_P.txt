"Its a Madhouse!!!! A Madhouse!!!!!"
Planet of the apes is one of the best science fiction movies ever made in my opinion. It has a interesting story, great performances by several actors, and great memorable scenes.  An astronaut named Taylor travels through space and winds up on a planet that has apes as the superior race and not humans. Humans here are primitive and not able to speak so it comes as a surprise when Taylor speaks to the apes and causes many questions to be asked.  Charlton Heston is great as the lead in the role of Taylor. One of the greatest actors of all time in my opinion and this might be his best performance in a film in my opinion. He really plays a character you can get behind and root for. That alone is reason enough to see this film.  The supporting cast is great as well. Kim Hunter is great as Zira, the open minded psychiatrist who becomes friends with Taylor. Maurice Evans is great as Dr. Zaius the not so understanding Orangotang who is the villain of sorts in this film. Roddy Mcdowell is great as Cornelious, the archaeologist chimpanzee. Mcdowell is one of the main reasons Planet of the Apes as a film is series is so great as he returns to give great performances as several ape characters throughout the rest of the films, except Beneath the Planet of the Apes.  The story is great and the action scenes are pretty well done. The music also adds to the tone of the film.  Many iconic scenes as well that you will always remember. Lots of good memories in this film for me.  The make up in this film is really well done for the time that this film was made. All of the apes look really good in this film and I respect all of the actors who had to sit and wait several hours for the makeup to be applied while they were shooting for this film.  Overall a great science fiction film. Recommend it strongly.
