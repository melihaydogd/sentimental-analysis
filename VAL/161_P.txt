This film will make you into a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus.
Predator is hilarious for all the wrong reasons, and I love it! Well, I say 'love it' but it's more like 'I like it quite a bit.' It's full of stupid, cheesy one-liners that are endlessly quotable (my favourite being the one I referenced in my summary just due to it's pure randomness.) I laughed a lot more than perhaps the film wants you to, and thought that the entire movie was actually pretty bad but for all the right reasons. Arnold Swarzenegger is as good an actor as he's ever been, but he carries this film well based upon his actions rather than words. The action is what you come to see, though, and it's all pretty good. John McTiernan expertly directs the film, keeping up the pace and making the Predator a believable and compelling villain. Indeed, the special effects are very good too and I didn't once see the Predator as just a man in a suit. Look, this is by no means a masterpiece. However, I can see why it has such a cult following - like so many of Swarzenegger's 80s flicks. It wasn't the best film I've seen; wasn't the worst; wasn't even all that engaging, but it was entertaining and gave me a good laugh or two. 7/10
