Not bad, worth the watch.

Yes, it can be a little corny, but it's a classic and made for people that want to learn self defense.

Ok, maybe wax on wax off doesn't really help much, but it is an amazing way to learn karate. Painting the fence, however maybe not.

The karate teacher is a psychopath, and the students are the followers making Ralph Machio (who was in his early twenties at the time) feel as if he goes near the girlfriend, he would pay. There aren't many characters except the love intrest, his mother, the teacher, the bullies. Not many.

Good movie, with the watch, a classic 80s film
