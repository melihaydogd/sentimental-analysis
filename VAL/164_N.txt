rather watch paint dry !!!
wot can i say to this waste of time nonsense film. myself and my husband thought we would treat our kids to a nice kids 3d film only to find there was no 3d except for a burger flying out of the screen during the trailer ha ha. oh yea i forgot there was a few moments when a fly made a split second 3d appearance.The storyline was irritating and boring and a total insult to the rep of the stars in it. I ended up gaining half a stone with frequent trips to the food counter out of boredom while my husband and children endured the rubbish before them. come on Disney get a grip. I'm surprised that we were expected to pay for this rubbish, we should have been paid to endure it for god sake.
