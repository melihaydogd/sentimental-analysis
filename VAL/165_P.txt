Zombeavers
Well, as soon as I saw Zombeavers advertised on another crappy DVD I had purchased I knew I HAD to watch it. The storyline is predictable, the same as most low budget mutated animal films, but these are MY FAVOURITE KIND OF MOVIES :-) Right from the off you can tell that the film isn't taking itself seriously, which is exactly how these sort of films should be made. The acting is okay-ish, not the worst I have seen by far! The dialogue is actually not that bad either, which makes a change! The effects are my absolute favourite part of this film, they are mainly puppets and they do not heavily rely on irritatingly bad CGI. There is nothing more annoying for me than a film with creature effects that look like a cartoon (Anaconda 3!!!!!), or over use of the same CGI scenes just flipped around (Megashark vs Giant Octopus), so this film took it back to the old school 'horrors'. I love monster movies, I love zombie movies and this really had the best of both worlds. Although I really didn't care for any of the characters because ofc they made stupid decisions, I really enjoyed watching how this film played out. Weirdly, i absolutely did NOT guess where this film was going! It is well worth a watch if you fancy a gory giggle :-) Enjoy!! x
