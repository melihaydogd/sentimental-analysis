Not quite incredible, but certainly still good.
Made when Pixar really were at their absolute peak, this is an entertaining film that manages to find that hallowed ground of appealing to both kids and adults.

It's a smartly written film, with some good vocal work from people like Holly Hunter and Samuel Jackson. Some of the animation at times is breath-taking too.

It's a bit long though, which may put some younger children off, and the plot is stretched out a little too.

On the whole though this is quality entertainment from the era where every Pixar film was a winner.
