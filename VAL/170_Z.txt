Boring
I think the high ratings stem from the unique characters that were created like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The special effects are good, especially for it's time. Back in 1977, this movie was revolutionary and changed the industry. However what remains, when you strip this movie of it's special effects and science fiction setting, is a basic plot that's been done thousands of times. It's very predictable and boring. I was 26 years old and one of the few people who never saw Star Wars. Everyone said it was good. So when I came across it on VHS three years ago, I decided to give it a try. Man, was I disappointed! It nearly put me to sleep. I don't I'll watch another Star Wars movie again.
