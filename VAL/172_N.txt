Too generic to hold your interest
The series has no identity of its own. It feels like every series out there, with the added disadvantage of poor writing and serious pacing issues. Additionally the focus on the equalisers family drama - which was the weakest element of the original 80s series - drags it down both in terms of pacing and making it feel like every other modern series. Personally I'm not going to bother with this slight offering but if others get something out of it then good luck to them. I am however sceptical of all of the glowing reviews
