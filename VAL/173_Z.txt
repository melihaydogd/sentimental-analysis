Not a film to watch for the first time when you're 30. I missed out.
I was 4 years old when Child's Play was released, and I remember seeing a trailer for the VHS release in a videotape we rented (which was obviously more children friendly). Since I became a Horror fan during my late teens, I simply missed out on the authentic experience of Chucky's mischief.

Today, with terrifying puppets as seen in films like The Conjuring, Annabel and Dead Silence, the fear of puppets and dolls has been taken to extreme levels. However, one must consider the fact that in 1988 the entire concept had been fairly new, and people around the world had been terrified with the concept of a kids' doll possessed by psychopath serial killer and targeting their them or their children.

Watching this in 2016 after a couple hundred other Horror features, I must say I felt like I was watching Comedy Horror (which is one of my least favorite genres). Chucky is not scary, he's ridiculous. The acting might have been considered superb during the late 80's, but is unauthentic and unconvincing in today's standards. Much respect to Alex Vincent (playing Andy) for starring in a film at the age of 7, but his performance makes suspension of disbelief impossible.

All I can say is that Child's Play is an excellent film for children who are not young and timid enough to become paranoid and prevent the house from sleeping at night 2 months after watching. Anyone else would find it amusingly ridiculous at best.
