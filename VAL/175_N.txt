Longmire set the bar, Yellowstone shimmied under it Limbo style.
Unwatchable for me. Yellowstone is filled with gratuitous violence, cringe worthy portrayal of Native Americans & caricatures instead of roles showing real humans. The acting is good, but even this fine cast can't fix lousy screenwriting.

Longmire spoiled me. It set the bar very high, but Yellowstone did the limbo flat on the ground ... instead of trying to match or exceed it.
