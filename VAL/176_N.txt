The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen
I never thought I'd be this riled up by one movie, but I am.The director took a story with an interesting premise and turned it into the most boring and nonsensical feature film. As much as I respect the actors in this, I have no idea why such talented actors would look at this script and think "Hm, I think this is something that's going to boost my reputation!".As nice as it was to see Glasgow in it's glory, it seemed like over an hour of the film's screen time was awarded to things that didn't even matter nor effected the film in any way. For instance, a shot of an eyeball doesn't have to take 5 minutes of our time. Then of course there's the pointless accomplice. Appears for 25% of the movie, doesn't say anything, doesn't really do anything. The film wouldn't have lost anything spectacular if he wasn't in it.If you're planning on going to see this, don't waste your time. You'd gain more excitement from watching paint dry.
