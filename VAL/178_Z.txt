Dark Western.
Clint Eastwood both directs and stars in this Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film, a western featuring Eastwood as aging reformed gunfighter Will Munny, lured out of retirement to collect a much needed bounty on the group of cowboys who cut up a prostitute. He enlists the aid of friend Ned Logan(played by Morgan Freeman) to help him track them down, which leads to the town led by corrupt sheriff "Little Bill"(played by Gene Hackman,who also won an Oscar) an amiable but ruthless man who resents these gunfighters in his town, and will stop at nothing,(not even murder) to get his way, prompting a violent showdown on a rainy night... Superb acting and script here, and works as a tribute to Clint's mentor director Sergio Leone, though this sometimes ponderous and overlong film doesn't measure up to their famous "Man With No Name" trilogy. Still, it is well done and memorable otherwise, with a haunting finale.
