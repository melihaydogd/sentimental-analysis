It isn't all bad
After seeing how badly everyone is trashing this movie, it made me want too see it all the more. It's all about your expectations, seriously did anyone really expect Catwoman to be a masterpiece in cinema history? Didn't think so! I won't deny i would have liked a little more than Catwoman ultimately delivers, but it isn't deserving of the poor rating is has here.

I agree that this is probably Sharon Stone's worst performance, cheesy lines don't don't suit her ability, but i thought that Halle Berry did a fine job as Catwoman, she got in to the role and did her best, despite some lame dialogue. The special effects equal spider-man's easily, as you should expect, and some of the action scenes are pretty good, sadly some are pretty bad too.

All in all the movie is below the standard it could, or even should be, but to give it a score of 1 is too harsh. It does entertain, and it only missed my expectations by a little (i didn't expect that much anyway) Watch it if you want too, it's not all bad.
