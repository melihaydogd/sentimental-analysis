Sit at the back!
Some bad acting from certain actors, some very good from others. Lots of jumps but that's what these things are about.

Plenty of REALLY AWFUL hand-held, zoomed cinematography that made it look cheap and amateur. Why do directors want to fill the screen with lots of out-of-focus stuff, and then deliberately shake it around to blur it even more? So from me, this enjoyable though brainless flick loses 2 points for it's equipment abuse.

Lots of plot holes if you sit and think about it but just sit back (way back, if you don't want to throw up in your popcorn) and enjoy the slasher ride.
