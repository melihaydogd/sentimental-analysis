A Prison Story that will leave you wanting...
I thought I had never seen this movie before and then I happened upon it on TV. Then I realized I was required to see this movie in public school(in which I zoned out with boredom).Basically it's a campy Forest Gump-like story of prison with the common tropes of rape and racism--but nothing like a real prison for most people--I mean who goes to prison and gets a cushy office job? It's okay for a generic movie but as a prison story you will be left wanting.In fact, here are a few reasons to see a different movie: 1 - The escape plan: It's silly and simple. Makes you think the prison was run by complete idiots. Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is much better.2 - The final escape: pretty anti-climatic. Just finally happens and then movie is basically over. Once again, go see Escape from Alcatraz if you're expecting extensive tunneling/swimming or something that makes you feel like the prisoner earned their freedom.3 - If you want a prison story about that best captures the essence of the desire to be free watch Papillon. It's roughly based on the French penal colony system during WW2 and numerous escape attempts.
