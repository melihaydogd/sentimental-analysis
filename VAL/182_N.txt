 I got a sore but at the theatre Movie...
I clearly can't understand how you thought this movie was excellent. Good ok but i had to hand out a 2 rating because. Too many people gave it a 10 without thinking. The story line is lame the length made this movie seem like you were waiting for the 3rd show 3 years from release date to come out. The battle scenes were lame. I was waiting for 1.5 hours for something to happen. Set up the plot the characters my but, look at this movie as a waste of time. I almost walked out of the theatre, and in turn will watch the next two on my Big screen at home where i can pause these boaring movies with lame actors but cool effects that i am willing to sit threw and see something interesting. Because the movie world is in need of a new #1 movie. Don't pick this one. It's like reading the table of contents in a magazine but having it 50 pages long.
