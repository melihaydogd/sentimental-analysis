The most amazing film I've ever seen when I was 2 years old.
My favorite character is Morla because he's so big and huge. I love the music because it is so naturest. My favorite song from the movie is Bastian's Happy Flight because I listen to it all the time. My favorite actor from the movie is Noah Hathaway. Happy Birthday Tami Stronach!!! The Childlike Empress is so cute. I wish this movie was a play at my high school that I'm going to real soon. I'll might play Morla when this turns into a play at my high school. I think everyone should watch this movie. Enjoy this movie for a movie night!
