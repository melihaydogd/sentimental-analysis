Worst film ever to achieve distribution
I have judged several film festival entries so I have seen bad films. "Under The Skin" is among the worst I have ever seen for a plethora of reasons: bad sound, bad camera a work, bad editing and bad directing. It's obvious the director is attempting to replicate the surreal mood of Lynch and Kubrick but he misses the mark in every way. Generally, surreal visual imagery can be effective if it is cohesively tied into a story or character. The director of this film forced several contrived and irrelevant scenes into the final cut in a sad effort to be creative but he just couldn't pull it off. If you want to see Scarlett Johansen's gorgeous nude body, go see this film. Otherwise, rent a real Kubrick film and see what a true artist can create.
