Good 70's drive-in fun
Pretty much a typical 1970's drive-in feature with cute girls,cool cars,good music and some nudity. A foxy girl's uncle gets sick so she gets her hot girlfriends to help her run his gas station in half cut t-shirts and short shorts. The station starts doing well so naturally the mob run gas station across the street doesn't like this at all and hijinks ensue. If you enjoy these kinds of films this one is worth watching.Not much humor but the acting is better than most these type of films and its very watchable.

Gas was .79 cents a gallon in this film,which along with the girls and the cars really makes me long for the 70's.
