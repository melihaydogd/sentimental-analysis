Awful is an overstatement!
After cinematic excellence such as 'Avatar' and 'Inception', here comes a movie that puts Hollywood to shame. I dare say, this movie was an utter waste of money and time. Lets start with the mixture of real life characters and animation. It is an absolute embarrassment to the movie makers to even think of such concept. The blend of both worlds did not do any justice to the movie, nor would it to any other movies in the future. Let's assume the target audience were only children, the least they could do is to let the movie be in full animation. 'Megamind' comes as a good example.
The jokes on the other hand were boring. Children did not find any of the jokes funny, what else us adults? The cinema was in complete silence during the "funny" scenes and many even walked out form the cinema. Comedy might be a tough genre to tackle, however; look at 'Finding Nemo'. They definitely did a great job in entertaining the audience.
The only reason why this movie might do average in the box office would solely be related to the curiosity and hopes moviegoers have. Spread the word. Do not waste your time and money on this. This movie was truly a slob and showcased how the people responsible were only interested in making quick bucks without being bothered about quality.
What's next? The Adventures Of Daffy Duck?
