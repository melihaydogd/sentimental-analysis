Nostalgia can't save this movie
I remember watching this film as a kid in 1984 and I loved it. I remember discussing my favorite scenes with friends and classmates. I cherrish those memories and that time period in my life. So I decided to rewatch "The Never Ending Story" today in 2021. I bailed out after about 40 minutes into the film. The boy reading the book is annoying, and in one scene he screams out loud like a girl for no apparent reason. The acting is hammy and most of the dialog is cheesy. Some of my favorite films from my childhood are timeless classics that still hold up today and I can watch them anytime (like Ghostbusters, The Karate Kid, Star wars, ect.) Sadly, The Neverending Story isn't one of them.
