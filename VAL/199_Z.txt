OVERRATED
I watched this film...I mean I have tried to watch it. But...after the first hour, heaven I could not go any further and I had to leave the theatre. Really over, over, overrated. Yes, the actors are fantastic, I loved them but the story is not well told. It unfolds so slowly. And, come on, another film about the hard life of an actor/actress in Los Angeles.....
