Not always believable but highly entertaining portrait of slick, shyster attorney
Based on the Michael Connelly novel, 'The Lincoln Lawyer' pulls you in right away with its intriguing title. Will it be about an attorney who's known for his honesty just like our legendary 16th President? Not quite. The Lincoln Lawyer is Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a slick and somewhat sleazy barrister who conducts most of his business inside his aging Lincoln Continental town car. But in a sense, the parallels between Haller and 'Honest Abe' are not completely off base. Like President Lincoln, Haller has an incredible command of the law. And more importantly, he's cultivated the right connections which enables him to call in favors at crucial moments, guaranteeing his success.

Haller is one of those characters that may be a little too cool to be believable. Nonetheless, film audiences will identify with Haller as a man who is never intimidated. Consider how he's not afraid to demand more money from his client, a member of a motorcycle gang who's now in trouble with the law. And when he meets up with the head of the gang to demand payment, he has no trouble asking for an additional $10,000. There's also humor to be found here, when Haller is granted a continuance from the Judge for his biker client, after advising the Court that he needs more time to question a new witness: a "Mr. Green" (Green of course being the additional funds owed to him by the biker gang).

The film's neo-noir narrative, conveys a heady verisimilitude of the California criminal justice system. For example, when Haller meets with a former drug addict client who's now been re-arrested (again for drugs), he advises her that she's going to have to do some jail time (as she's already been through pre-trial rehab). When the addict agrees to give up a confederate, Haller gets her back in pre-trial rehab (an event which later figures prominently in the plot).

We break into the second act when Haller is introduced by a bail bondsman to a new client, Louis Roulet, a young Blueblood from a rich, Beverly Hills family who turns out to be a psychopath and possible serial killer. Roulet (played menacingly well by Ryan Phillippe) has been charged with beating up a prostitute but claims he's been set up by her along with a sleazy associate. Haller soon establishes a link between a former client, Martinez, who was accused of murdering a prostitute, Donna Renteria, in the same way the current victim was assaulted (both had wounds on only one side of their face). When he visits Martinez at San Quentin and shows him a photograph of Roulet, Martinez won't even look at it, as he's bitter at Haller for not believing in his innocence at the time of trial and forcing him to accept a plea bargain which sent him up the river for at least fifteen years (I was not entirely convinced that Martinez wouldn't have entertained Haller's offer to at least listen to what he had to say, in an attempt to "make things right").

Haller conscripts an investigator who he works with, Frank Levin (William H. Macy), a former police officer who looks like an aging hippie, to see if there's a connection between Roulet and the earlier victim. Haller is murdered after leaving a cryptic message on Haller's voice mail, indicating he was on to something. Roulet breaks into Haller's home and admits that he's guilty of murdering Renteria but invokes attorney-client privilege to keep Haller quiet.

Roulet goes beyond the usual serial killer routine (murdering prostitutes), when he threatens to harm Haller's wife Maggie (played by an underutilized Marisa Tomei) and their daughter. While it may have been a stretch to believe that most serial killers such as Roulet would include his own attorney as one of his targets, the way in which Haller figures out how to undermine Roulet without losing the case, is quite ingenious.

Haller calls in Favor #1 from his drug addict client who he got into pre-trial rehab. She fills jail house snitch Corliss in on the fact that Renteria had a sexy snake tattoo on her body that only the killer would have known. The assistant DA puts Corliss on the stand, but Haller discredits him by citing a case in which Corliss's testimony resulted in an innocent man being convicted. Roulet's case is dismissed but he's detained for questioning due to Corliss's testimony about Renteria's special tattoo.

Haller enrages Roulet by implying that he was responsible for setting up Corliss's testimony. Once Roulet is temporarily detained, Haller figures that's enough time to get to Maggie's sister's house (where Maggie and the daughter are hiding) so he can intercept the now out of control Roulet and call in favor #2 from the biker gang honcho. The once calculating but now impulsive Roulet shows up at Maggie's right on schedule and the gang members end up beating him up in broad daylight. Not likely, but again entertaining.

When Haller figures out that Levin had discovered Roulet's parking ticket put him near the scene of Renteria's murder, along with Martinez's possible ID and Corliss's testimony about the spider tattoo, that may be enough to put Roulet away for good.

I wasn't very surprised by Roulet's mother admitting to killing Levin and also shooting Haller, as it was pretty obvious from the get go that the mother-son relationship wasn't very kosher.

'The Lincoln Lawyer' may be nothing more than an extended Law & Order episode, but it's still highly entertaining. I didn't buy all of it, especially the rather easy way in which Haller prevents the killer from doing harm to his family. I also wasn't entirely convinced that the DA really had enough evidence to convict Roulet at a second trial. Nonetheless, 'The Lincoln Lawyer', with its realistic atmosphere and excellent performances, proves to be a notch above many of films in wide release today.
