Overrated and cliché
Let me start with the conclusion. This movie is overrated and cliché. Here's why. First of all, the movie uses a typical American Hollywood formula. Introduction character, introduction problem, introduction second character / sidekick, problem solving seems to be getting progress, plot twist, opposition (bad guy or whatever) gets the upper hand, main charecter saves the day and then the movie ends. This doesn't necessarily have to be a problem but this movie basically felt like two long cartoon episodes stuck together. In the past there are several TV show episodes where someone gets stuck in the realm of the dead on the Mexican holiday dia los muertos. One can ask how original it still is. You combine that with characters that aren't too interesting - it even has the typical seemingly useless animal sidekick that plays a minor role - and a plot that's predictable and one can understand why I can't possibly consider this movie to be a classic. Don't get me wrong though. I still enjoyed this movie somewhat, although that was mainly because it's of its highly polished animation and the presence of a good 'vibe'. The music definitely helped with that.

Summary:
Not original story;
Typical movie formula;
A bit predicatable;
+ Highly polished animation; + Good vibe.
