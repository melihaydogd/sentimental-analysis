 I did not enjoy the film.
I found the changes made in the story line showed Mr. Jackson did not understand the book, -at all.  His his replacing the character of Glorfindel, a warrior, with Arwen, a Lady of the Realm (turned female warrior for no apparent reason other than to attract Xena fans), completely destroys the point of the Tolkien trilogy.  He simply can not undo the damage he has done with this "substitution".  A significant segment in "Return of the King" hinges on the fact that there are not female warriors.I am so disappointed in the film and will not be watching any of the following installments.I just wish Mr. Jackson had bothered to read the books before he butchered them.
