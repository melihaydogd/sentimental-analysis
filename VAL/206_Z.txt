Great settings and imagination...but the movie?
Yesterday, I went to go see Oblivion. I thought I was going to see more, and in some ways I did, but, in some I did not. The settings in this movie were phenomenal, and it had better acting then I expected. It really hit heart in the ending. But, I honestly thought this movie was to slow, WAY to long, a little boring, and 100% confusing. Toward the end I started to take guesses at when it was going to end. Their was always a perfect spot to end the movie, but instead, they add on 15 more ongoing minutes that waisted my time. The ending definitely could've been better, although it was very deep. It was just how the plot worked and how everything was just all over the place you just lost focus and were not able to pay attention. As much as I want to say I loved it, or even liked it, all I can say is it's okay.Oblivion is a fresh new idea that you may like for sci-fi fans (although I am one) and do encourage you to see this movie.
