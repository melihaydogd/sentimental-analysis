Another stereotyped movie!
As for exception of some good characters spoof, the obvious clone of "American Pie", but not so straight, "Another Gay Movie" is, as its title says, another gay movie that, it seems, try to laugh about different circumstances what happen to gay people, since teenagers to old, or at least that the kind of life that is put in our eyes, and that is not a good thing.

The plot is not a novelty if you have seen the "American Pie" films, the difference here is that the entire world is gay. Now if you note the continuity here as in "American Pie", you can watch that some scenes are exactly, in its base, the same thing. The characters here is four guys: One lead, Andy Wilson (Michael Carbonaro), one nerd, Griff (Mitch Norris), one straight-like, Jarod (Jonathan Chase) and a effeminate one, Nico (Jonah Blechman, as i understand, he work too in "Luster", a film of Everett Lewis). The guys want "bring" and (In spite they don't want to accept it) "receive" in sex. They want their first time. And more when Fluffer, the experimented lesbian ( Ashlie Atkinson ) gives to them the lesson of success. The other characters can be easily noted quickly: The closeted bisexual father of Andy, his "Mommie Dearest" (That was funny). The sexual fantasy of Andy, his teacher (A surprise to see Graham Norton here). Bonnie, Nico's mom. Angel, a striptease teacher who is in loved of Griff and the guy want to have sex with Jarod. This are, at least, the most important characters for the movie and is at the same time a good proof of how the gay stereotypes in movies go on in middle of social messages of equality and respect for gay people. Im sure that this is a gay movie made of gay people, or at least, a part of it, and is surprising but this movie could be come a kind of funny, but at the same time, i hope that is not my impression, but i see it so offensive.

If we can called that follows the same tradition of "Scary Movies" and, obviously of the "Another movie ..." kind started, i think, by "Not Another Teen Movie", the spoof here works too with the dirty things, mixed then with the "American Pie" gags. But here, and that was the problem of "American Pie" too, is that the character's sexuality is humiliated in different "funny" ways. Now, the problem that have "Another Gay Movie" is that, i think, goes to far, thing that "American Pie" doesn't commits, and for worse, is not a message of tolerance at all, just for the stereotypes. I well known that the "Scary Movies" count with this silly, some time dirty jokes, classic of spoof that was developed thanks for "Airplane!". The difference is that, at least "Scary Movie" concern is about scary movies. Then, we can say that the concern of "Another Gay Movie" is about gay movies, but i don't see it the point. First of all, horror genre have different marks through movie history, and "Scary movie" want to spoof all that errors that have, in it ilogicity of its plots or its characters, gay movies are based in real people, who deserves respect as the rest. Now, the "Scary Movies" (Althoug there's some better horror spoof like "Pandemonium" or "High Anxiety" or even the gay spoof "Creatires from the Pink Lagoon" could work better, as many others) spoof scary movies, very well, "Airplane!" spoof accident films as "The Naked Gun" series do with cop movies, thats very fine. This movie could spoof the different gay movies, but when you see it, its clear that don't. Obviously, the plot is defined by the gay stereotypes. Sincerely, i don't think that is a thing of proud.

So, "Another Gay Movie" is a "great acceptance comedy" just because is like "American Pie" a straight one. Well, then, at least for me, made something different. The thing is that they picture the gay world most important things are beauty and sex. Unfortunately this is a point that at least this movie get, because it's true, but is not another reason to laugh. For the rest, different exaggerated sexual issues, coprophilia, and airs of pedophilia and zoophilia are the content of the jokes. And for last, the boys dreams, in his first times, we witness almost everything, even, just for a note, a double penetration. So, this is a funny movie anyway, the jokes, Â¡Oh! Come on, are just jokes, this is not serious film, yes of course, then the thing of values and respect for difference is just a joke too isn't? "Another Gay Movie" show to us that. At least is shown to us that gay world then is not so "gay" as it seems, and this could be a good thing just if the film never want to laugh with this.

Thats it, "Another Gay Movie" teach me that. Teach us that hot guys, like for example that muscle and hot stud called Matthew Rush, as i guess a gay porn star that appeared in a lot of Falcon gay porn movies. Damn, that was a hot guy dancing in the classic gay music, but you hear it talk and it seem to hear that kind of vanity guys who only cares about sex, their penis size and how their loved to give and bring, at least, that was a thing that "Another Gay Movie" teach me and that is a thing that probably i going to remember anytime i watch one of those Falcon videos.
