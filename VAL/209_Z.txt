Decent film, bad casting
To be sure, 'Peeping Tom' has some very good ideas in it--so good, in fact, that I'm amazed that Hollywood, in it's zeal to put every form of serial killer and their acts on the screen two or three times over, hasn't done an update of the film. Powell was clearly influenced by Hitchcock's themes (someone actually discusses scopophilia--here pronounced 'scoptophilia'--in 'Peeping Tom' instead of simply depicting it) and style. Unfortunately, the overall production is just not up to the task. The plot is a little too heavy-handed and literal at times, the characters somewhat cartoonish, and the pacing leaden.  Really, the biggest flaw with the film is the casting of Carl Boehm in the roll of Mark. Looking somewhat like the offspring of Joseph Cotton and Peter Lorre in one of 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien's 'If They Mated' routines, Boehm plays crazy all right. That the problem, though: That's *all* he does. At no point did I believe that Mark is capable of holding down not one but two jobs. Perhaps the British standards of creeping out your fellow employees is different from ours here in the States, but the first time Mark locked eyes on me while mumbling in that high, lispy, vaguely accented voice of his, I'd be on the phone with Human Resources like that.  What makes Norman Bates such a compelling character is that he does have the ability to function in society from time to time. He can be charming, friendly, and even funny when he wants to be. Mark, however, is incapable of any of these qualities. His timidity is so pronounced that it's hard to believe he could ever screw up the courage to actually kill someone because that would require human interaction. And the idea that anyone--even someone as apparently oblivious as or with the appallingly low standards of Helen--could actually fall in love with someone Mark is hard to accept. Marion definitely sympathizes with Norman, but it is a pitying sort of sympathy. She senses there's something not quite right about Norman, and because of that at no point can she ever feel a romantic attraction toward him. Norman is irreversibly deranged and without hope. 'Peeping Tom,' on the other hand, seems to suggest that Mark *can* lead a normal life and perhaps even have a girlfriend if he just stops his habit of killing women.
