Most Disappointing Movie Ever.
As a die-hard Simpsons fan, I felt very disappointed with the feature film debut from the greatest sitcom ever. The Simpsons movie never reaches the heights of its TV counterpart. The first 22 Minutes or so are right up there with there with above average to good episodes of the greatest sitcom ever. The jokes in first 22 minutes are abundant and intelligent. The laughs really begin to dry up when the hideous story takes shape and we are left with environmentalist crap where Homer's small silo of pig poop and his own poop contaminated the already massively polluted Lake Springfield to the point where the Schwarzenegger led government puts a massive dome over the town of Springfield. For a good twenty minutes the film is largely laugh less. The theater was also. The movie does not really recover and rarely musters more than few chuckles. The denouement is less than impressive by Simpsons standards. The extensive cast characters are relegated to background and bit players at best. Many favorites are absent or left little to say and do. The writers take more easy outs than we see in the worst episodes and the movie itself plays it safe a little too often. The movie is seems to be a more dumbed down version of the show. Yet there is still much to recommend about the show we all love so much and for so long. The characters retain their depth and truth. The tone is consistent with the current episodes, which may be part of the problem for some. The story and the lack of big laughs are the movies greatest faults. The Simpsons Movie, which runs longer than 3 episodes is not even as funny 3 bad episodes, but it is funnier my 3 least favorite episodes. It is great that (Albert) A. Brooks puts is another funny appearance. Though Russ Cargill is not nearly as funny as Hank Scorpio or even Jacques the bowling alley gigolo. The movie a disappoint on many levels is a must see for any longtime Simpson fan. Not the funniest movie ever nor the worst movie ever. Not even close. But as one of the biggest Simpsons fans in the world for me it is the Most Disappointing Movie Ever.
