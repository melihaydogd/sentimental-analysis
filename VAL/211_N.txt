don't think so
just watched this...not very good...started out OK...russell crowe...Christmas lights...handcuffs...possible broken nose on a nice babe in a car...let's go...but then "the plot" takes over...i put the spoiler warning on because of the broken nose thing...now i think about it...her nose really was broken...but why????......you will find out...the question to ask is if this is a good movie about the endemic corruption of the los angeles police force in the 1950's or a bad movie about the same thing...i opt for the latter...it really is a pretty funny movie...not in a good way though...and it's long...now i have no problem with long movies...i loved 1900...but with this movie the first 2 hours are just a painful setup for the dumb ending...it's kinda like naked city on valium
