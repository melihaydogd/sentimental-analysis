good and bad
Well I knew the movie would not be the same as the comic book. I am sure even Alan Moore and David Lloyd would have made changes having as many years of perspective as they have on the comic. I think by bringing in different writers much of the plot lost its deeper meaning and irony. I think some of the content of the comic making it worthy of being made into a movie was completely left out. Instead content was once again filled with action scenes and special effects. Also some of the non British actors could have used a little more practice on their accents. Overall it was a good movie with good acting but I think the ending didn't stay true to the comic.
