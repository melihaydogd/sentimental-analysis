Lecture or entertainment?
I'm a big lefty on the political spectrum but this movie legitimately felt like I was being preached to by a raging angry socialist on a stand. I mean I always think it's nice to come away from a movie with a message but when that message supersedes its entertainment value the movie's quality is reduced. I feel like this really applies here.
