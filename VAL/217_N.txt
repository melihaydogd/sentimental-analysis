plain bad... Battlefield Earth bad..
Music - one guy with keyboards, plot - worthy of a sequel of a bad movie, acting - below average, stereotypes and clichess - ALL there. Waste of time, unless you are high. I didnt know its australian, by the amount of patriotism it feels like a pure American proud-to-be film. I have just watched Extinction before this - compared to this thats an amazing movie.Oh and the aliens wear capes :)
