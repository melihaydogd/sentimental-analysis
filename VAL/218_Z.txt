Good, not great
Clearly, some people disagree with me, but while this movie was certainly entertaining, I didn't think it was great. It had it's moments, but all in all, I've seen better movies.

The one thing all my friends kept telling me: "The Matrix has a great plot" I think it's a sign of the kind of brainless movies being released this days that when any movie with a sniffing of a plot comes out, people automatically take it for the next "Godfather". The same thing happened with "The Sixth Sense". The plot here is passable, but far from excellent.

There are two parts of this movie that were really excellent. Once is the mind-bending special effects, which were extremely well-done. The other is Laurence Fishburne, who is at his best as "Morpheus", the leader of this rag-tag group. Keanu Reeves does his best no to overact the part, but it's really Fishburne that stand out.

Would I recommend it? Sure. Is it the greatest thing I've ever seen? Not by a long, long shot.
