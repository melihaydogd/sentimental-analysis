Too much brooding and head scratching
I specifically went to see this film because Jennifer Garner was the star but I left the theater scratching my head. Garner was the only decent item in the movie.

She gave a good performance. Too bad the rest of the movie didn't hold up.

For once I would like to see a comic book-to-movie movie that doesn't require the viewer to know all the backstory of the main character before seeing the first frame. We get bits and pieces that are just scenes shown in flashback with no connection with what is going on.

The story had promise and touches of greatness but the plot holes were just too much to ignore. Electra is an assassin but we don't see how hard she is. It would have been nice to see her complete a few "jobs" before the meat of the film starts.

There were some interesting fight scenes - like with the sheets - but a lot of the moves and sequences we have seen before. Also as powerful as the bad guys, "The Hand", seem their ends came too easily after a lot of fighting - it seemed all for naught. Some the camera work was so hurky jerky it was impossible to know what was going on.

There were too many scenes of people staring off in the distance, either brooding or reflecting. To me it was dead space.

Just a personal note. One thing expected in these big budget SFX movies are great one liners you can repeat to all your friends at the water cooler the next day. They tried to do that in the film but it didn't work.

Not that this a bad movie and perhaps all the hanging plot points will be cleared up in the next film (if there is one), it is a decent rainy day filler.
