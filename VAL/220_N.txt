An Absolute Mess
I never had any intention of watching this but it showed up on Netflix and so I gave it a shot. What a mess of a movie. First of all we need to throw out the whole Noah fairy tale as it is presented in the Bible. If one were to take the time to look, we would see that flood/purification myths existed long before the Old Testament was even a thought in the writer's minds. It was all an evolution of thought to try to come to grips with the reason people are the way they are. This movie is about a guy who, for some reason, becomes God's darling, even though he is so full of ego as to think he knows anything. He goes from being a loving father to being tyrant and, basically, an abuser. At no time in this film are we privy to God "talking" to Noah. He simply decides what the plans are. I'm not talking about the animal thing, which is incredibly ludicrous. God pretty much sticks them on the Ark and then puts them in a kind of suspended animation. Russell Crowe walks around like he is constipated. He is so intent on his own version of how things will be that he turns his back on his family. Yes, he is the provider, and the times would make him unapproachable by his wife and children. He is the grandson of Methuselah (where did they pull that out of?); you know, the guy who lived 900 and some years (good old Anthony Hopkins) and apparently was some sort of conduit to God. Crowe/Noah builds the Ark, a giant box rather than the stereotypical ship with the little house on top that schoolchildren are used to. Anyway, at some point he gets it in his head that his mission is simply to save the animals and he and his family is to die off, ending the reign of man on earth. His daughter in law (sort of), Hermione Granger is impregnated after Hopkin cures her barrenness. So old Noah decides that if the baby is a daughter, he will simply end its life. He has also offended his son Ham (the patron saint of actors) by not saving a young woman he has fallen in love with. Ham spews hatred and has every right to. There is also on board, a stowaway, who is really a Satan, who is going to take over the family by killing Noah (with Ham's help). Ham, of course, to some cultists, is thought to be the reason for races that are inferior. So he is the new Cain, even though he is confused and depressed. The way this all ends is so pathetic. There are implications that are hard to imagine, but, then, it's just a silly version of an equally silly story. Oh, I didn't even mention the rock creatures that were punished by God and eventually helped Noah build the Ark. If there was even a semblance of some sort of classic point here, it ended when these guys showed up. I thought that the John Voight TV miniseries was bad, but this one takes the cake.
