Good in trailer awful in action.
I had heard a lot about this movie at BBC and other channels, so it got me very curious to watch it, but as soon as i watched it all of my imagination of a good movie got ruined i actually faced a terrible movie which is a complete waste of time to watch the ending is so unprofessional and the whole movie had nothing to provide the audience. Im sorry but the movie was awful. But there is a positive point in it the Korea's movie industry is getting bigger and better I'm actually a big fan of their movie industry. Hope for better movies.
