Possibly the greatest romance I've ever seen.
Charlie Kaufman is a very talented screenwriter. Being John Malkovich introduced me to his unique mindset and Adaptation blew me away with its creativity but this film is his best.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind follows Joel, a man who decides to take a medical procedure in order to have his partner Clementine erased from his memory after he finds out she did the same.

There have been some great romance films like the Before trilogy and my favourite being Her, but this film just might overtake that film to be the best romantic film ever. Never have I seen a romance as creative and thought-provoking as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Out of all the Kaufman films I've seen this is the deepest. This film raises really important questions regarding love and relationships. Is it worth it to forget previous relationships entirely just because of the bad moments? Would you want to forget all the happy memories just because things got a bit ugly later on? It's these questions and so many more philosophical ideas that Kaufman wants us to think about and it's told in such an endearing fashion.

Like Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry is an extremely talented director. To be able to make this film come to life isn't easy and Gondry managed to capture the heartfelt and emotional weight of Kaufman's script beautifully. The way this film is told is very interesting. The film's narrative goes back and forth a lot and has multiple surreal moments which is what makes this romance unlike any other. The characters are extremely well realised and the performances to go along with it are excellent.

Eternal Sunshine shows a side of Jim Carrey which we've never been exposed to. We've all known him for his over-the-top and comedic personality but he's never done a role as serious and restrained as Joel Barish. Carrey is absolutely superb here and makes his character as relatable, realistic and human as possible. He should have got a Best Actor nomination at least. This is his best film along with The Truman Show. Kate Winslet has never been better. Her chemistry with Carrey is believable to its core and she deserves her Best Actress nomination. The supporting cast with the likes of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson were also terrific in their roles.

Much like Her, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind will have a special place in my heart. This film examines love and relationships in a beautiful and impassioned manner. Charlie Kaufman, without a doubt, deserved to win the Oscar for Best Screenplay with Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth. It's become one of my favourite films and I cannot recommend it enough.
