Bad and boring
The beginning is OK, but the rest is crap. A man is mutilated by a grizzly bear and evil men let him lye 'dying' and almost buried. But he soon very fast recovers unexpectually and can do everything in the wilderness. i expected to see an interesting and exiting movie but it turned out to be exceptional bad and boring - one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. How in the world can this ridiculous unwillingly funny movie get so good reviews ..? Sudently he stands up and walks and talks and crawles along this lengthy movie. I can see a purpose in this film but, my god it is weitten in capital letters". I did not feel anything about him, just laughing at this rediculess and unsatisfiing movie. What a turn off.
