Zip Goes Up Zip Goes Down Zip Goes Up Zip Goes Down
I wasn't sure what to really expect with this film (probably should have read a blurb!), a political-esque drama certainly didn't enter my mind.The movie moves along ok until about half way when things escalate ridiculously, where our lead starts acting like a crack addict. I get it, addiction is addiction but at this stage of the film it just overplays it.Strangely this continues for (guessing) about 10 minutes and then seems to find itself again.There are 2 significant points about this movie:
1: The cast is much better than the movie, especially Headey and Winstone.2: You could mount a case for this being a bio pick of the Clintons?
