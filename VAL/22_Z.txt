Boring and unfunny. Basically nothing of substance happened during the entire movie.
OK my title is a tad bit harsh but it is basically how I feel about this after watching it, it was certainly not all boring and I think as a whole is more watchable than some other movies but for a 'comedy' was not what was expected, there was not even a moment of laughter during the whole movie let alone a small chuckle, I feel this could just as easily be call a drama instead of comedy and it could have easily ended after twenty minutes or gone on another 2 hours and either way I feel the audience would end up knowing the characters just as well and had just as good a story told. The acting was great and I found the individual characters likable (the tiny amount that I knew them) but I found the story to be very thin without any substance and character development to be non existent culminating by going nowhere and simply ending on a flat note.
