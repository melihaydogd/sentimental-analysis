Punched above their weight
Yep, punched above their weight and got smashed. When working on a low budget, understand that and work with it. The dialogue was atrocious, the characters swing from one end of the spectrum to the other within the same scene for no reason. Full of cliches and unrealistic character interaction. Why on earth did the aliens set up a 1 acre farm with slave labour? Again, another alien flick where apparently the aliens just don't have the idea to develop weapons that are accurate despite their technological superiority. Just so much did not make any sense. Oh look, watch it on a rainy afternoon, have a couple of laughs
