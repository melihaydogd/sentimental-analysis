Refreshing

You can't watch this movie without patience, it is a really really slow burn. But unlike blockbuster trash that's constantly served - everything serves a purpose to the plot. Life is not a 90 minute show. And this movie isn't about runtime or show. It has a message, it has motif, and it feels like reading a classic. Great, honest job.
