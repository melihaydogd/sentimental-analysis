it's certainly different but I disagree that that makes it better. My issue with this film is the difference in tone and style. I adored Volume One for its masterful visuals, great action and fun story. This film is on the opposite end of the spectrum in genre. It's a more grounded, story driven conclusion to Tarantino's original saga. And I wouldn't be bothered if the two films were so different. If Tarantino did an entirely separate, story driven and grounded story; then I'd be down with it. I would. But the fact that the first film was an excellent action film and this isn't annoys me greatly and the disconcert between the two is stupid. Pick a style and stick with it. I personally don't think that this is the better half of the saga, not even close. Don't tell me that I am just a blood thirsty, action junkie who cannot enjoy dramatic stories. I am not. I love drama as a genre but I hate how Tarantino has tried to mesh the two into this saga. If you like it, then that is fine but it really did not work for me.

The carry over story is still really good. The through lines remain and I was still thoroughly engaged in the story-line. It includes some really incredible and gut wrenching scenes which were the highlight of the film. I really admired that and one scene in this movie makes me actively dislike the ending scene of the last movie(not action scene but emotional scene). The film finishes the story well enough but I do not think it recaptured the magic of the original.

Uma Thurman was excellent in this movie and maintains the highlight of this saga. We also learn a lot more about her character in this film which I thought was a genius idea. There is one specific piece of information I wish was left ambiguous about her that they revealed. It doesn't affect quality in any way but I think it would add a lot to the mystique of her character if we weren't told this piece of information.

David Carradine was great as Bill. Bill was strange. I THINK I liked him as an antagonist but I cannot be too sure. He hit all the right cues and was threatening enough but I can't be certain in whether he's an excellent villain, or an average one. He's in that little grey area.

Daryl Hannah was appropriately loathsome as Elle Driver. She did a good job and the actual character was a pretty decent one. She was a good minor antagonist.

Technically wise, it is still a very nice looking movie and I do still appreciate Tarantino's masterful style. That said, I do think that the novelty of seeing his style in Volume One does wear of in this film. Not that that retracts quality, it just makes it harder to praise when it doesn't feel as fresh and invigorating. The use of black and white was also very nice but it did occasionally come of as abrupt and strange.

The score for these films is incredible. The soundtrack is excellent and I cannot commend the composers and Tarantino himself for assembling such an awesome array of music and sound effects.

As far as action goes, I was underwhelmed in this movie. I had doubts that they could outdo the Crazy 88s but I still had hope. They. Did. Not. There is ONE action scene in this film and it was fine. It wasn't too memorable but it was certainly entertaining. None of the action is mediocre it just isn't great when compared to the original, which I am inclined to do because A] It's a direct continuation and B] I can.

​ I really wanted to like this movie but I was thoroughly disappointed. The first one was such a fun, inventive, stylised movie that I could barely poke flaws in. This tries desperately to ride of Volume One's steam and ultimately fails. I only, and I mean only recommend you see this film to see how the story ties up. Aside from that, it was a very bland and forgettable experience.
