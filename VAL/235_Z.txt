3 of the Elements the Last Airbender didn't master...
Warning: Spoilers
I will tell you straight up who I am. I'm an avid fan of the television series, in my mid twenties, and a bit keen on film analysis while not being a outright critic. I feel it's important to know this as there are going to be quite a number of people stemming from this train of thought that will be convinced to see the movie.

Prepare yourself to be royally disappointed. And I'm not talking about booing; I'm talking about near walking out the theater before the film ends while feeling miserable to the same extent as to those that actually finished the movie.

What makes this movie bad?

Book One: The Element of Character Development. Suppose Steve Erkle were in a movie and all he did was try to get Laura Winslow to marry him. He didn't have any funny lines nor did anything ridiculous happen on his journey to her heart. Eventually after much rejection Laura marries him. What you have here isn't a story of Steve Erkle, you have a love story with ambiguous characters that have names but could have really been anyone. What makes Steve the Erkel isn't just in what he does, it's how he's portrayed along with his relationship with others. Avatar: The Last Airbender (ALA) succeeds at poor character development.

Examples...the movie is abound with them. I will just stress the key ones for ATA fans. -Sokka's importance is nil. You don't see a hint at why he's traveling with the group outside him from him wanting to protect his sister. Other than that, he stands like this O.O throughout the entire movie. -Katara: You really don't learn much about her except that she's the last water bender in the Southern tribe.... yup....that's it. -Appa/Momo: They are animals... no personality....zero importance and no scene that distinguishes them from a light post.

I will say that Aang, Zuko, and Iroh were at least passable. Shallamalla succeeds with these characters.

Element 2: Too much for the Avatar. Let's admit that a movie summing up the water book is an outstanding task. Shyamalan tried. He successfully put the gist of the story in a movie. He chose to leave out or twist elements of the show that fleshed out the personalities of our beloved characters. This was a bad move. Sokka wasn't funny and had no funny parts in the entire movie as he was portrayed as serious. Event leading up to the end were always shown in short scenes, some of which make little to no sense. Many times when observing the dialog you find yourself asking "What did that mean?" or "Why was this said there?". I feel that had Shyamalan added small, character developing dialog to some of these short scenes and the slow moments, the movie would have been outstandingly...better.

This movie lacked the personalities of characters whom weren't built in 2 hours. Without strong character personalities, the audience is left watches faces move from one place to another...very quickly. Next time Shyamalan, one some of the slower scenes, make them meaningful, because viewers don't want to see bending stances and nothing really happening...

Element 3: 3D? 3D isn't not used to it's fullest if at all. If ATA was a pop up book that didn't do the pop up, but did the background/foreground thing, this would be the 3D in theaters. Too many parts were blurry and completely wasted better visual display.

The Avatar did start off as a master of airbending, which means this movie had to do something right. All I can say is that if you want to watch ATA with real people and all the funny and integral side moments that flesh out main players sucked out of it, this does it right. The story is told, but did the series not have a more useful Appa, a more useless boomerang, a more brave Katara, a more bald Zuko? Fat Iroh? Darker Water tribe? Less O.O. Better lines? Better fight sequences? Less mature Aang and Sokka? Less meaningless scenes?

To whom was this marketed to...the fans? If it was for the fans, then forget the "I'm going to make it culturally phonetic" bull and keep the English sound. Trust me, after 10 minutes of "Ahng", "Earow", and "Soaka" you will have torn your ears of the "Soakets". The fans will hate this movie.

What about the people that haven't seen ATA the series? Well, if they want the story shown to them real quickly, then here it is. But they aren't going to know the magic each character brings and will be left laughing at the same non-nonsensical acting and scripting as anyone else. At least they have comfort in knowing that the TV series is much better.

What about kids? Seeing as it's a Nickelodeon TV show surely they can love it. I'm inclined to agree. Kids know nothing of character building, foreshadowing, bad acting, poor 3d visuals, insignificant scenes, racial type-casting, and film pacing to know of all that ATA fails in. If you're a kid that hasn't even seen ATA before and want to catch up to speed, by all means, get see the movie. Watch it in normal D and quickly leave the theater before you get bombarded by the fans that will complain about the movie.

Ending Verdict: A waste of box office space and 3d visuals. It has made me want to watch the series again. But not mastering the important elements in making a good movie only hurts the fans and the audience. Shame on you Shyamalan. I do believe I went Avatar State and erased the last 3 days of my memory.
