It's hard to describe just how much I hate this movie..
Seriously. Will Ferrell comes across as some kind of retard who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near kids, let alone as one of Santa's Elves.

I suppose my experience of this film is worsened by the fact of being stranded in a cheap motel in Canada during the holiday season while my "companion" insisted on watching this. She thought it was "cute". Nuff said.

This is just such a loathsome, nauseating and at times, diabetes inducing, nightmare that I am at a loss for anything more constructive to say.

I think I probably despise Will Ferrell even more than Jim Carrey after being exposed to this abomination, although I will admit they both give me the major creeps in very similar ways.

I am pretty open minded about films. I didn't even mind Battlefield Earth or Barb Wire that much and I like all kinds of obscure art-house films as well as some of the lowest rated trash. But this? I just don't get how ANYONE can give this film a rating above awful..
