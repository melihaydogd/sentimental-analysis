Gut wrenchingly postured
I can only imagine this is and American vision of the English of the past. The insipid an desiccated presentation of English class differences. People were either 'stuck up' and boring or inarticulate, forelock tugging and boring. Creepy, cold piano chords accompany the most banal of conversations. as part of a truly deadly score throughout. Ralph Fiennes 'county' accent is full of public school flaws and in portraying a rather self conscious man, over egged it so much that I just felt embarrassed for him. . All players wooden through and through Terrible screenplay. Not a glimmer of humour or self reflexivity in any of these characters which renders them 2 dimensional. I'm glad that so many people seemed to enjoy it . What an utter waste of money it would have been otherwise. I was one of the few people I knew who found 'The English Patient' to be an insipid bore and am surprised to find that we have not evolved from this pretentious and silly imagining of the English class system of yore.
