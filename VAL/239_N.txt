A Travesty
Few words come to mind while trying to write about this particular piece of cinema. This is quite possibly the effect of actually watching the unfortunate burlesque that was G-Force. I will admit to having seen this movie under duress and out of obligation, which likely will have decreased the potential for enjoyment.

A kid's movie isn't always meant to be a meaningful work of cinematic art. However, filling children with this meaningless dribble will lead more towards the stupid and thoughtless society of George Orwell's 1984. This movie had a budget of over 80 million dollars and more than tripled that in gross revenue. What does this say about today's society? It points towards a general decline of intelligence and as well as a decline in the ability to discern between that which is worthwhile and that which is detrimental.

My last complaint is the music choice. Someone got paid too much for finding the songs featured. I could have saved them money and just directed them to billboard's hot 100. The music was an obvious and shameful attempt at pulling in the masses of popular media controlled adolescents.

I want nothing further to do with this morbid bit of refuse.
