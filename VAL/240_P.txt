Criminally underrated war masterpiece
"This is one of the best war films, of all time. It is extremely intense and almost seems as relentless in the portrayal of war, as the Taliban must have been in their daily skirmishes with the American forces.

This tells the story of the most decorated company of the Afghan war, their outpost, which happened to be a tactical blunder surrounded on all sides by the Hindu Kush mountains and their fight to the finish which led to the highest battle honours.

There are interesting insights on leadership and the effect that it can have on the subordinates as well as the opponents. Then, there are pointers about the instincts ruling the heart and the mind, in the heat of the battle.

It is first rate and it is a real shame that it hasn't received the recognition that it rightfully deserves. among my top 3 films that I have seen this year, pre and post lockdown. Its rating on Rotten Tomatoes (of 91%) is closer to the quality of the experience.

Can't be recommended highly enough. Is in the unmissable category."
