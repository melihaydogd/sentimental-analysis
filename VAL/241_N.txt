One of the worst Movies of the 80's!
Dirty Dancing is in my opinion a dreadful, cheesy movie. I disliked it the first time I saw it and my opinion of it has not changed since then! It is a badly directed and produced film and far to sickly sweet. It is an awful movie which for some strange reason was very popular despite its awfulness. Even the song 'The Time of Our Lives' is dreadful, Middle Of the Road bland 80's pop-bad music for a very bad film! If you have any taste whatsoever DO NOT watch this movie!
