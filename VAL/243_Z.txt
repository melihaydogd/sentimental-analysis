Not as good as they'd make you believe
Don't believe the hype -- people seem to go out of their way to tell you how great this film is. The truth is that, when it comes to the crunch, it's actually not really anything that special.

Pearce, as the man who has no short term memory after he sustains a brain injury when his wife is raped and murdered, is competent enough, but this film does get really annoying in the way that it loops within the plot in order to get you back to the same point you were at 2 minutes ago -- and then moves onto the next scene.

That was really annoying.

A lot of this only makes sense in the last scene -- when the Sammy story finally comes to a point -- but by then it's taken an effort to sit through a lot of the rest of the film.

Make no mistake, it's not bad, but it's not anything sensational either.
