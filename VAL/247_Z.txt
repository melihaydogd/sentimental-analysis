Spielberg's "All The President's Men"
The difference is...the latter wasn't about anything but the men trying to get a story. I find it ironic that when a film desperately wants to tell people that truth should be available to the public, it fabricates a lot of details to service what amounts to a dull story. While beautifully crafted, this film falls very flat, mostly because the agenda was to link Trump with Nixon. Since this has been done to death, very little is as amusing as watching social elitist scramble to dig dirt. One is left with why Katherine Graham's husband (former editor of the Washington Post) had committed suicide. But that's not the story Spielberg wants to shove down your throat. It is about freedom of press. And forgive me for saying...newspapers don't have that power the internet has today. Before they had to fact check and wait to get the story correct. These days (and the WP is the worst offender) they get the story out FIRST. SO forgive the public for not pumping their fist in triumph at the end when the Supreme Court agrees with the 1st Amendment (yawn). That is the problem with this film. Had it been made in Obama's 8 years, we might have braced ourselves for the future. Which...it's even more odd that we are able, each one of us Americans to share our opinion such as on IMDB or on our own blogs. When was this really an issue other than to lay defiburillator paddles on...printed press?! Look, I'm always in awe of Spielberg's talent. This is a beautiful movie (as usual). It's crafted really well. But the earnestness of his message is similar to a child telling you about his butterfly collection that you know doesn't do jack for society. And it beats the drum over and over again. Strong strong performances, but this was such a letdown from the energy that I know will most likely be in "Ready Player One."
