It is not a remake!
Don't take note of the other reviews. It follows on in the same light as the other Ocean movies. It also isn't a remake. Who cares that it's an all female cast? It shouldn't matter. Don't take it seriously exactly like you didn't with the others. It's funny, light and good to watch.
