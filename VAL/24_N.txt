a tale about 2 disrespectful kids
The 2 kids in this were pure evil. It's hard to hope they have a happy ending when they seem to love to torture their elders. In this, Ice Cube, plays Nick, a guy who likes a lady, Suzzanne, with 2 nasty kids. Suzzanne has to go to Canada for her job and Nick volunteers to take the kids there on New Year's Eve. They have problems at the airport and bus station, so must travel in Nick's new SUV to get there. The kids make a mess inside the car. They lock him outside and try to drive away. They make a truck driver think they need help, so he runs Nick off the road. Eventually, the SUV is totaled. The kids run away to their dads and are disappointed with what they find. But, I didn't feel bad for them since they were such brats. Eventually, they all make it to Suzzanne's party. And after all Nick went through, she acts ungrateful and doesn't care her kids are so evil. But since it's a kid's movie, you know they all end up forgiving each other and happy at the end.

FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it because the kids were so mean. If you don't like the kids, you can't hope they end up happy. What they deserved is a switch.
