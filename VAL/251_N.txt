Aliens in present day Earth
Weyland Industries has found an unknown heat signature in Antarctica. Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) gathers a team to explore a pyramid buried deep underground. Inside they find an altar which they activate. Meanwhile three Predators have landed to collect their trophies.

This is an idea created out of desperation. Both Predator and Alien franchises had run their courses. Somebody came up with the insane idea to marry the two franchises. There is a reason why only Henriksen returned. It should have been an obvious mistake to bring Alien into present day and on Earth. It rips apart the original Alien franchise canon.

If there is any redeeming quality, it is to be found in the movie itself. It is a pretty simple creature feature with 2 different creatures. One must abandon all hopes of the enjoyment from the original franchises. There is no hiding the creatures. They are revealed quickly. Director Paul W.S. Anderson brings along the monsters and produces nothing good. There is no imagination. At least enough money has been spent that the production doesn't look completely cheap. That is all the good I could see here.
