Welcome to the house of dumb
Remember, halfway through Cabin in the Woods, how it went completely off the rails in the most delirious way possible? That was bold. Expect no such curveballs from You're Next. This basic, cheapo slasher has taken two years to reach the silver screen, although it's not clear how it ever made the step up from DVD - it has Kim Newman's Video Dungeon written all over it.

The story concerns a reunion of the Davison siblings at their wealthy parents' country home. Tensions bubble under the surface during some sporadically engaging early scenes. Then the family start getting picked off by crossbow snipers. Soon the killers are in the house, taking out family members one by one as they inexplicably go exploring rooms on their own.

There will be blood; there will be predictable twists; there will be a dearth of surprises.

A lack of innovation wasn't a problem for recent horror hit The Conjuring, but then that movie was propelled by skillful performances, the subtle building of tension, a fine script, plausible character motivations, elegant direction and editing, and some imaginative scary encounters. You're Next has none of these things.

Does it have anything going for it? The presence of a strong female protagonist is always welcome if Sharni Vinson is a scream queen, then she's not the one doing the screaming. Also, the film's score is distinctive, starting with dark, searing drones and slipping into some late rolling synth. But it isn't enough to make up for all that's risible.

Truly, the dialogue scenes had my auditorium sniggering. Later, when the blood starts flowing throughout the repetitive fight scenes, sniggers became full laughter. And yet there is no evidence of archness or knowingness on writer-director Adam Wingard's part. If this is a parody then I never felt like I was in on the joke. It just seemed like a poor script made into a poor film.
