Something that rhymes with Hobbit, starts with SH
The third part of the trilogy (?!) is by far the worst ever movie inspired, if inspire is the word to be used in any relation to this movie, by a Talkien book.If Peter did it for money - I understand. I hope he is happy for taking the money from people earning 250 EUR per month in my country, and that is with the story which is about how gold eventually corrupts everything. In a way, he proved the point, didn't he?But, if Peter truly believes that THIS was the Hobbit, than something is seriously wrong with his reading and directing skills.Hollywood at its worst, 144 minutes of violence based on anti-war children book. Could there be a bigger nonsense than this?!Fortunatelly, this gives an opportunity for someone to make a good Hobbit movie soon.
