Rubbish

A movie that lacks a meaningful score and loses itself in its pretentiousness. Movies should be made to entertain, not by for a globe or some other Hollywood bauble that we are supposed to live in awe of at yet another meaningless ceremony. Stop delivering this drivel and make real movies.
