"Network" + "Brazil" + "Clockwork Orange" = "Videodrome"?
Wow!  My favorite actor and my favorite singer in the same movie!  Deborah Harry (of Blondie fame) gives a great non-blonde performance as an "emotionally energized" radio show host, and James Woods is a scummy business-minded owner of a seedy TV station.Like "Brazil" or "Twelve Monkeys" this movie will make you think, and even though there isn't really much violence or horror, your mind will fill in the parts that aren't there.  The ability of a movie to do this makes it a must-see alone.  You constantly ask yourself "is this real?" just as the main character is asking the same thing.One thing about this movie is that they never really answer a lot of things. As we watch the main character go in and out of reality, the audience is never quite sure what is really happening either.  They never tell us.  They never truly explain who is behind Videodrome, or even what happens to James Woods.  If you didn't like the ending of Network or Twelve Monkeys, then you won't like the lack of explanation here either.Lots of underlying messages here too, involving television, pornography, and technology - all of which are more significant today than in 1983.  Note common themes such as the head in a box.  Excellently made film, the only thing that would have made it better is more story.
