A Few Good Ideas
Before the brilliant &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and the epic &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; writer-director Quentin Tarantino burst onto the independent films scene with this morbid little piece of filmmaking called &quot;Reservoir Dogs.&quot; It tells the terribly unpleasant story of a few chatty thugs, with color-coded names, who assemble in an abandoned warehouse after a jewel heist goes terribly wrong. Loud arguments, gun-fights, and a nasty little torture scene ensue. Still, Tarantino had a few good ideas, and I&#39;ll give him that. Narrative through flashback was done with a clever flair and I did like the way Tarantino chose to have all his characters lacking morals (even the &quot;blue rat&quot;), so we wouldn&#39;t be forced to sympathize with any one of them. That&#39;s all that &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; really is though, a few good ideas but a genuinely unpleasant moviegoing experience. Rated R. 99 minutes. 4 out of 10.
