Could Have been a lot better. They really destroyed this characters.
This movie is to conventional, it's very boring and slow. The director doesn't make a good job, the cinematography is very conventional, but you could really think that this movie is a telefilm, a boring telefilm. The movie is very small. It only takes place in one scenario and the cinematography is very weak, you'd think that this movie is a low budget movie, but not... it has a very big studio behind it. The cast is very, very good, the actors try to be charismatic and cool, but the script is so bad and everything seems so forced that you lose the quality of the cast. The VFX are good, but there aren't any action sequences till the first movie hour, what really makes the movie slow in his first two acts. The OST is conventional. The aren't horror scenes. The characters could have been charismatic but they aren't. Could have been so better... everything had such a potential but they just threw everything...
