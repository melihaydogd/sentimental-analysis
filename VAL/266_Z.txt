It was okay-ish, not enjoyable though.
It might be my own perspective and I belong to a different religion and can't really comprehend the Christian culture and its strictness but the movie wasn't enjoyable at all. It just took way too long before something worth watching happened. As a normal viewer, it was a waste of time honestly.
