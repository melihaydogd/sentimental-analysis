Not very timeless.
I believe this is the first of the more recent full-length animated feature films to lose the "Disney touch." For some good points first, the animation is great and story had potential, about a poor street urchin named Aladdin who meets a princess in disguise, the palace-fatigued Jasmine, on the streets. They fell in love with each other afterward, but the only problem is that Princess Jasmine can only marry a prince according to palace standards. Thrown in the mix is the evil vizier Jafar, who wants to control the land, and the slapstick Genie of the Lamp. And, the music is great - "A Whole New World" is breathtaking and "One Jump Ahead" is very catchy.

However, I do not believe the screenplay/story is very captivating, lacking the charm and uniqueness that was found in previous films like "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Little Mermaid." The movie was told in a way that resembles a teenage-bop love story. Some of the characters, particularly that of the Genie, was very over-the-top. Robin Williams did a very overzealous voice acting job for the character and he seemed too comedic and nonsensical. He made too many modern-day references, considering this movie is supposed to be set in ancient times. And, the character of Aladdin took on too much of a "surfer dude" personality - not very genuine.

Overall, I'll admit I'm probably in the minority, at least on IMDb, for negatively critiquing this movie. But, "Aladdin" ranks as one of my least favorite movies from Disney.
