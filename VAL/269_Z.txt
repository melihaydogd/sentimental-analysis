Boring, Cringy, NOPE
My partner and I really tried to watch this movie even though we do not watch musicals really. 1 hour into the movie and we definitely had enough and switched to another movie as it just was way too boring - I just could not feel during this movie, whether joy, sadness nor love really. The musical parts were so cringy making us feel very uncomfy and we ended up skipping those parts.

I was honestly looking forward for this movie but this was a bloody disappointment.
