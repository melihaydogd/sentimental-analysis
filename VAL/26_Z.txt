Davidson is worth showing up for...

Some of the cast is really good but I absolutely cannot get past Marisa Tomei. I'm not sure who maps giving best roles but let's cut it out. I know of some terrible cancel culture cruel stuff she was a part of and it was really disappointing. Worth watching for Davidson, Burr, etc. dory's good too. Some real stuff 've just hit that one issue.
