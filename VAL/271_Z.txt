Craftily engineered film that lacks authenticity
Peter Jackson's most recent film, a remake of the 1933 King Kong, has been receiving some critical acclaim. I must admit, the film presents some action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat and overall it never becomes boring. That in itself, however, is not enough to make a good film. This begs the question: what does this film have to offer besides a twenty-five feet tall monkey? Sadly, not much.

The dialogue is sparse, which restricts the actors in displaying their capabilities, which some of them have shown to possess more than a little in previous films. The music and scenery are candy for the senses, though oftentimes feel too artificial. This is a problem of the production in another area as well. There are quite a number of funny or scary moments in it, but most of these are so obviously engineered that one is almost ashamed to react to them.

Overall the film lacks authenticity. If you have seen it, ask yourself: what was in there that I have never seen before. For me the answer was a disappointed 'nothing'. It is hard to justify the making of this film on that ground, especially considering that it lasts over three hours. Peter Jackson has shown himself to be a competent engineer. Now it is time for him to come up with something authentic, something that conveys new ideas or feelings, something that does not have a minute of wasted screen time in it.
