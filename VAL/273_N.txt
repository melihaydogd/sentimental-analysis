I will never get that hour and half back. Ever
There are some films so bad, so cynical, so devoid of charm, wit, or intelligence. That were made without care, a script or an idea that you wonder why no one stood up when presented with the script and told the writers (dubiously termed here) to reconsider their lives and that maybe they would be better off working some way away from any kind of keyboard.

EVERYONE involved in this pathetic film should be put into stocks on Sunset Blvd with "I worked on Keanu tattooed on their foreheads", so everyone can throw throw rotten fruit, bricks and small animals at them. 

This, along with Jack and Jill, The Adventures of Rocky Bullwinkle, Dude Where's My Car and all the Deuce Bigalow movies is a disgrace. So bad that I would rather watch that contemptible fool donny trump spew his hateful vitriol, at least he believes it.

Awful, awful, awful
