A boring classic
I enjoy most classic horror movies, but this one is one of the worst that I've seen. I almost fell asleep several times while watching Children of the Corn. The only thing "scary" about this film is the awful effects they added. The children are just annoying and nothing more. I didn't care who died because none of the characters had much of a personality. I expected more out of such a popular movie.
