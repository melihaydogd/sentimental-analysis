Great uplifting idea spoilt by completely unnecessary crudeness
It's a real shame. The premise of this film is about a man who turns his life around for the better. Now normally this can only be a good thing, and Jim Carey does a fine job of portraying the loner and nay-sayer that makes the journey to the eponymous 'Yes Man'. But, and it's a big but, along the way the plot is spoilt by unnecessary crudeness. For example, there is one barely disguised oral sex scene, comments about masturbation and liberally-peppered crude language. Now, I'd have less of a problem watching this film if it had a higher age rating. At least I'd know what to expect, but even my 13-year old boy was looking distinctly uncomfortable throughout. As I said, there really was no need for the crudeness. The story could have stood up completely on its own merits without this tawdry nonsense. A shame, because the rest of it was very good. This family gives it 3/10.
