Twilight with aliens
I'll be honest here. I Am Number Four is a yawn. And when I'm not counting minutes till it's over, I'm snickering at the amazingly cheesy lines. Seriously, I haven't watched a movie with lamer lines since the Twilight series.

Which was a shame, really, since I was so anticipating this movie because a) Alex Pettyfer was so cute in Stormbreaker and I'd like to see more of him, b) I love Diana Agron, and c) I love a good teen drama/superpower movie. But IANF was such a disappointment in the way that there's nothing believable about the movie AT ALL.

So the Mogadorians want to kill the 9 surviving Lorien kids with superpowers (called Legacies). Why? It's not really clear. Ethnic cleansing perhaps? One of the characters explained how the 'Mogs' don't colonize, but decimate instead. So why go to all the trouble of searching for the 9 scattered in all corners of the world? Why not wipe out Earth and be done with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway, right? It didn't help that right when Number Four's number is up (pun intended), he decides he wants to be 'normal' and 'go to school'. And the overprotective guardian said yes. Sure, what's a murderous predator compared to listening to your teenage ward's whining 24/7 right? And what's with Number Four's propensity to constantly ignore (sound, life-saving) advice anyway? Is he trying to get killed? Or is it that it's more interesting to have a character that breaks all the rules since the main character never dies, anyway right?

All in all, I'd say the movie's a flop. The characters are either annoying, unmemorable or carbon cutouts of every other movie. The appearance of Number Six makes it slightly more interesting but in the end she's just a blonde version of Megan Fox. The script was painfully shallow and the story's just...meh.
