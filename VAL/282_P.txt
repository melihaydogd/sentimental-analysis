A Halloween favorite from Dr. Seuss
Halloween is my favorite holiday and I love to have a good scare from watching a really good horror movie, or just watch a classic animated special like this one. I remember this special WAY back when I was a kid in elementary school, when it was on TV of course. But they don't show it on TV anymore now, along with The Halloween Tree, which is another favorite of mine and a few other favorites too. But I was lucky to order myself a copy from Amazon.ca.

It's also a great film about facing your fears, like Ukaraiah did to save Whoville by jumping in The Grinch's wagon of spooks, to stall for time. Now that scene REALLY scared the hell out of me as a kid. I would like point the interesting critters of Punker's Pond. The Gree Grumps like pink cats living in tree stumps (I am a cat lover), but I wonder what does the bottom half of an Hakken-Krakke look like? a seal's body? or the body of an Plesiosaurus? well I don't know, but it never hurts to use your imagination.
