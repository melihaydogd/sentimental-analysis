Why Indian movies don't make to Oscars.....
I normally don't go to cinema halls to watch Hindi movies because leaving the very few ones I think they are heavily plagiarized either from other regional languages or from movies all over the world. Well, today me and my friend went to see "kai po che" because Chetan Bhagat is one of my favorite author and this movie is adapted from his novel. But we didn't get a ticket so we went to see "ZILA GHAZIABAD". After watching 5 mins of the movie I realized why Indian movies don't get nominated for Oscars. This movie has a cast which any director may dream of.. I mean Vivek Oberoi, Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi, Paresh Rawal, Asutosh Rana,etc etc.. either the Director is a new one and has simply followed the styles of other movies or the actors are desperately in need for some money. It lacked acting, direction, editing everything.What hurts me is that the audiences was cheering the Ludicrously odd action scenes which can only be possible if the hero is "Superman". Same clich√©, songs, dance, dialogues. Sitting there I can tell what will come next after a particular scene!!!So when will Indian movies be ready for Oscars? Movies like Barfi (I haven't seen it yet) failed to even nominated for Oscars. So what is the meaning if we produce more than 1000 movies each year and not even a single movie get nominated for Oscars!!. When will this change? It's the Indian audiences who can change this thing. If they are not ready to change their thoughts, ideas or perspectives, India don't stand any chance at Oscars. My rating 2/10.
