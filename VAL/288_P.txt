Great Time @ the Cinema
A young man, one of the last of his kind, is on the run from those who want to kill him.

Wow! This film was an absolute blast! Cool effects, intriguing plot line, & impressive battle scenes.

It was like watching Terminator but with supernatural beings.

There's a little something in it for everyone. The sci-fi/fantasy genre mixes in with some romance and action. My kind of flick.

I haven't read the books but here's hoping there's a second film because man this was so entertaining!

Highly recommend watching this on the big screen. This reminded me why I go to the movies.

7.8/10
