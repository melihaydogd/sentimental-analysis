An inspiring and entertaining movie from start to finish
I think this is the only other non over the top role I've seen Jim Carrey in other then the Truman Show and he was great! His chemistry with Zooey was adorable.

The movie had a great message and is perfect if you are looking for a light-hearted, positive and fun flick.
