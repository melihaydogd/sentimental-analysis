A simple , Typical Movie
A typical romantic movie indeed.... it was like most of the 1990 movies nothing was new........The only enjoyable scene i find is the one in which Andy goes to the guy's family house and plays the game of "BULLSHIT". and at the end i was expecting the same "termial ending" in which the guy is running behind the girl on the airport terminal however to my "big surprise" the guy caught her on the bridge so that was a new thing...... the acting by both Kate and Mathew was good.......but again i think the story didn't had that much in it to make use of the expeties of these good actors....And i still cant figure out why the friends of the hero always have to be that lame as the two guys in this movie???
