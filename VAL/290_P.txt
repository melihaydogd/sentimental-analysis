talking dolls do not make a worthy species!
What can I say, other than, Doctor Zaius is one of the great antiheroes or antagonists. He's not a villain. He's just not. Pay attention.  How can you dislike this thing? Linda Harrison also is a wonderful understated presence, especially her first appearance where she balks at Charlton Heston, then... leans forward to *sniff* him! It's terrific.  It has all the charm and ritual of a medieval action film and all the thought of science fiction at its best. The sequels lack, but, the first film really had something.  Don't watch the remake. It just doesn't have anywhere near the guts.
