I wasn't expecting much from this...but WOW.
I enjoyed the movie so much, that I came onto IMDb and registered myself just so that I can post a review. The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from beginning to end. The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and seriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a consistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being involved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things. In my honest opinion I would say that it is the best Fast & Furious movie to date. I want to go see it again!(by the way, I realise that this isn't the best review in the world or might even be an awful review, the point is that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and felt I should contribute to it's high average ratings).
