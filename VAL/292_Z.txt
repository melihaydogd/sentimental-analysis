It's not horrid. Here are some honest thoughts.
Hyped as the worst film of the decade so much that it didnt seem THAT bad while watching. Kind of a reversal of hyping something as amazing only for it to be just ok.

The first few songs are quite unorganized and Rebel Wilson's song is disturbing, at least to me. After Judy dench shows up it gets decently entertaining. The dance number after that is good and the absolute showstopper, was Skimbleshanks The Railway Cat. Jennifer Hudson was Jennifer Hudson. She was good. If the first half was as organized and taken care of as the second half was, it would be much better. McKellen was very good as well.

Look, CATS is a hard show to even sell to a stage audience. It's an acquired taste. It's not for everyone. Some parts (cough) Skimbleshanks, were very well done while other parts (sneeze) Rebel Wilson's song were atrocious.
