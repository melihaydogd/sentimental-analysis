Beautiful Film
A real tearjerker. I laughed so hard I almost cried to death. I watched this film when I was 14 and it really changed my life. It turned me into an extreme horror fan, only to be disappointed with tons of garbage films afterwards that never really compared to The Butcher knife's sharpness. If anyone knows some even better, more gory and obscure films, please let me know. PS Did anyone else get a headache from all of the piercing screaming and sound or was it just me
