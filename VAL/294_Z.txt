Not impressed
All critics and movie critics agree that this is an AMAZING film. I disagree, there were some great kill scenes and moments of suspense, but I fail to see how this is an incredible film. The plot is different (I don't get how money and mass killing relates - its never explained.) I didn't notice at all how the film was inventive. In Cabin in the Woods, it was supposed to be not your average story, and it really wasn't, which is why i love it. This one not so much. The first scene was disturbing, but only because of an older ugly man having sex, but also how unoriginal the scene was. I left the theater thinking, "cool, and moving on". This is only my opinion, other people liked it which is cool, but i left thoroughly unimpressed.
