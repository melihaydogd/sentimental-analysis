wildly overrated
The most overrated movie since LEAVING LAS VEGAS. Wildly improbable plot turns, especially the bedding of the hooker. A ridiculous contraption. Take a gander at the memorable quotes page for this entry; if that looks like good writing, I've got some leftover Shane Black screenplays for sale.

Comparisons to CHINATOWN indicate that, well, the reviewer is just desperate for something as good as that classic. A double feature would swiftly reveal this to be the hollow pretender that it is.
