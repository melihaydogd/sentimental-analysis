Fairly standard Statham movie here...
"Killer Elite" was exactly what I had thought it to be, a decent action movie without any major surprises or plot twists. It is basically straight out of the highway the entire time. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't mean that "Killer Elite" is a bad movie, it just makes it a very predictable one.

For a Jason Statham (playing Danny) movie, it is textbook material. I like his movies and that is why I decided to watch this movie as well, even though there is nothing new to be seen here. Action, fighting and testosterone from start till end.

I was somewhat surprised when I found out Robert DeNiro (playing Hunter) was in the movie, which only made it all the better, despite him having a small supporting role. And Clive Owen (playing Spike) was really, really great in this movie. He was so well-cast for that role. However, I must say that the one that carried the movie in, my opinion, was Dominic Purcell (playing Davies) - even though I usually don't like his acting or movies much - he did a really great job in "Killer Elite". And truth be told, then I didn't know it was Dominic Purcell in that role before I checked it on IMDb.

"Killer Elite" has a lot of action, which is to be expected, as it is a Statham movie after all. I was thoroughly entertained all throughout the movie. However, it would have been nice with some big plot twists along the way. I haven't read the book on which the movie is based, so I can't say how true it is to the source of whence it came.

If you want a decent action movie without too much to challenge your intellect, then "Killer Elite" is a good choice. Lots of action scenes, lots of macho stuff, lots of good actors, and that is more than enough for almost two hours of movie entertainment.
