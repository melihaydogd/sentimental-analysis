Quite possibly the worst film ever made
Most bad movies, even though they are bad, can still provide entertainment value for its listeners by providing bad dialog to make fun of, or glaring plot holes that are fun to point out. But "Catwoman" is literally SO bad in every conceivable way that I personally couldn't even find enjoyment from pointing out all its faults-- there were just so many.

As others have already pointed out, the film crams it down your throat that Halle Berry is a CAT-woman, to the point of being insulting. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The acting is dreadfully bad, the lines are terrible and terribly delivered (not even George Lucas could write dialog this bad), the action sequences are out of place and usually happen for no logical reason, and the film's continuity suggests that two different people with completely opposite personalities edited it. Hollywood would do the whole world a lot of good if it blacklisted this director from ever making another film.

I've seem some crappola movies over the years ("Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Killer Klowns from Outer Space", "Gigli") and I can enjoy even the bad ones because I stop trying to immerse myself in the story and just laugh at the film itself. Unfortunately, "Catwoman" was so bad that I couldn't do either-- it has no story or compelling characters, and is just such a pile of dung that it can only be described as an utter waste of time. I warn anyone considering this movie that you are preparing to throw away two hours of your life that you can never get back. Friends don't let friends drive drunk, and they sure as heck shouldn't let them watch "Catwoman."
