Sorry, waste of my time...
Alright, so I saw this movie since I have a thing with the number 9, like Melissa McCarthy and this was supposed to be some mystery in it. Well, even after reading other reviews I cannot understand what's mysterious about this movie. The end reveals everything as well as why three lives are intertwined. The only question popping up my head was "is this it?!?!" I read some reviews to see if I got it right and yes, that was it. Although beautifully put together and wonderfully acted, in my opinion The Nines is a pretty dull movie.
