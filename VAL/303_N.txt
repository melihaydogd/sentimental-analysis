Overrated
In my opinion one of the most overrated movies of all time. This is the worst Tarantino movie out there, I dont understand the movies popularity. Its just so bad and it doesnt make any sence. But on the other hand the acting is good and Samuel L Jackson is as good as you can expect. I guess it is just not for me and maybe you will like it.
