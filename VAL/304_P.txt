Mixed Feelings
King Kong is a well known story to millions of people and director Peter Jackson has brought it back to the big screen with much longer screen time and much bigger budget. Is it worth watching? My answer would be yes. Is it as good as Titanic or any of the Lord of the Rings movies? Definitely no. I have to admire Peter Jackson's courage to lengthen the story to include more human emotions and he succeeded in one area, but failed in another area. The relationship between King Kong and the "beauty" (Naomi Watts) is well defined and actually evoked a lot of emotion from me. The tragedy between King Kong and the "beauty" has connected me with King Kong, a computer generated character and I felt sad to see him die. However, Peter Jackson also created a similar relationship between the "beauty" and male (Adrien Brody). This human relationship of risk-all for a beauty does not work well and it is greatly overshadowed by the relationship of King Kong and the "beauty." The other human characters are just like cardboards that are not really interesting and inconsistent, except Jack Black character who is supposed to be the evil character of the movie. One example of inconsistency of character development is the captain who switches from greedy, practical minded character to bravery and heroic not just once, but actually twice in the movie. King Kong would be a much better movie if it only concentrated on the love story between King Kong (the Beast) and the "Beauty." It can be much shorter and much more entertaining. Overall, King Kong is still a good movie, but it is not as enjoyable as The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe or any of the Lord of the Rings movies.
