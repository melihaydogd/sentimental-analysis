I really liked the first three seasons but since season 4, the show really changed. Season 6 is probably the worst. They have added so many characters that we don't even get to see Barry Allen as the Flash anymore. The last seasons have focused so much on Iris that I started hating the show! P.S. I apologise for bad english, It's not my native language
