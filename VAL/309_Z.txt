"Batman the Accountant"
Oh dear! I can't say that I really enjoyed this one! Let's make a movie about an autistic super-accountant who uncooks the books for the world's biggest criminals... OK, that's not actually a terrible premise... now let's also make him a martial arts expert... OK ... and he's also a crack shot killing machine... right ... oh and he's also Ben Affleck... I mean, it just reached a point where there was no way it was going to be believable! (Sorry this is definitely a rant rather than a review!!!) This movie is basically Batman the Accountant. He even has a tragic backstory, and intense combat training somewhere in East Asia. I was willing to suspend my disbelief, but the narrative was farcical and filled with unnecessary flashback upon flashback and convenient coincidences. To quote one of the characters: "This makes no sense!". And of course there is a cheesy accounting montage! Real people do not write numbers or data or formulae on walls and windows, they use a computer! I know that's not cinematic but seriously, how many times do we need to see this trope? And whilst we're talking tropes - autism is not synonymous with superpowers. Yes some people on the spectrum have exceptional, enhanced abilities and it's OK to make a movie about this - but there is a point in this film where it suggests that all do, which isn't the case. OK, rant over! Not even the wonderful J.K. Simmons and Jeffrey Tambor could save this one...
