Drags on
Had to watch this for a class and boy, does it drag on.. I like older films and this one started out well. It was interesting and had me intrigued but quickly became boring. It dragged on and on, focusing on seemingly unimportant details. The last fifteen minutes would would have been better received, and maybe even shocking, if the movie as a whole was better. I wasn't remotely invested in these characters.
