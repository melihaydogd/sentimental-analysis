The Three Stooges meet Maxwell Smart in the Rodent World
Having read so many negative reviews, I approached this film with some trepidation but I found it actually very enjoyable.

If you can accept the premise of rodent heroes, in the same way as you might accept mutants or convicts in the same fashion, (in X-Men or the Dirty Dozen), then you're halfway there. The excellent animations, seamlessly blended with film are superb, as is the pacing. The humor and dialogue are a combination of slapstick and subtlety and therein I think lies a problem for many viewers, maybe too much subtlety...

Youngsters will appreciate the slapstick, tweens will get what they can from it, teens may find it lacking and adults, well, we all bring different viewpoints to our seats in the cinema, do we not? While it does not have anywhere near the emotional impact of the first part of Up, it is a quite polished and sophisticated undertaking and I consider myself fortunate to have ignored the other reviews and taken a chance with it.

I would give it a very solid 7 but considering the beating it's been taking, I will give it an 9 in an attempt to counteract that - and I don't feel guilty in the least for doing so.
