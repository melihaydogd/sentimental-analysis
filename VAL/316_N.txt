not worth spending money watching this
well the movie really sucked. good thing i didn't pay to watch this movie. it was kinda confusing in the beginning as it wasn't shown clearly that it was actually 2 different time settings-past and present.but other than that, its just a typical over-hyped Hollywood movie. nothing great about the story line. it was rather bland and predictable. it was almost as bad as devil's due. needless to mention the bad acting which made the whole experience of watching this movie even worse than it already is..smdh..and the whole story behind the mirror isn't revealed either-as to how it became haunted or why is it hell-bent on killing people.. it really doesn't make any sense. i've seen b-list movies which are far more better than this.. cant believe it made it to the box office. wouldn't recommend anyone to pay to watch this movie.enough said.
