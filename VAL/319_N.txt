Oh. The confusion was total. Do not watch!
Looking for a good movie about fasting? Do not watch/pay for this one. All in all it is just a mess of bad moviemaking mixed with a strange back and forth message about fasting. it surprises me that they got Walter and Jason onboard this project at all. And what also truck me is the long sweeping bodyshoots that where alsmost he whole time. Wanna know about fasting in detail? Search for Jason Fung on Youtube and watch the longer talks. There you will really learn a thing or two.
