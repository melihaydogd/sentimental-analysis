Watching hair grow - in real time
Let me recap - a kid is being born as old man. As he grows, he is becoming younger and younger. Until he "shrinks" and dies at "infant age".

As he grows older (younger in fact), he watches everyone around him becoming older and older. He watches others die. In fact, he watches them die even more, as he is brought up in a retirement home.

As he is "growing up", no one seem to be asking any questions regarding his situation. Everyone seem to be perfectly all right with their observations. Not one visit to a doctor. Nothing, although everyone around him seem to care a lot for him.

Throughout the movie, many "duh-wisdoms" related to life and death are being quoted. These quotes oversimplify reality to the extend that it makes you think than nothing else seem to matter.

It seem that idea was something like -- "once we quote these; the audiences will forget about the sheer stupidity of the story" (giving the reviews here on IMDb, they may have been right, too).

I understand that this movie suppose to have some "deeper meaning" and I think I understand what it intended to be.

In stead though, it has become a cross in between Forrest Gump, Legends of the fall and many other movies, resulting in over two and half hours of absolutely nothing.

THREE Oscars? Come on guys. This movie is bad.
