Why did you have to destroy a good romantic and inspiring movie with so much musical?
I know that these type of movies are not for everyone, I realize that it can be boring and that is what happened with me, but it doesn't have to be for everyone. If you re not a demanding guy, if you re a patient viewer with a cigar relaxing at his sofa yes you might be thrilled. Despite that, i Think that Ryan's and Emma's good performance was wasted because it had such a good dramatic/ romantic story that led to motivation and a pure inspiring movie relation to music. I agree it had to be with music and acting but without so many musical songs every couple of minutes. I think the direction was quite poor and the lighting wasn't that great. Its one of those movies i guess that half of the crowd won't ever see again and the other half will re-watch.
