It is an OK movie
I'm trying to be fair here and rating it 6/10. It's a descent movie, likely worth watching for most people. I watched it a few years back, before I really heard about it, and thought it was OK. I made it through the whole thing, but there were parts that dragged and it's also borderline depressing at times, but has enough humor sprinkled in to get me through. it IS quirky, and I can see how the 'cult classic' gets attached due to the repetition of certain comedic themes throughout. It's definitely not a 10/10 movie, and likewise the 1/10 reviews are basically just a reaction to it's overrating.

I've heard a lot about how great it is since the first time I saw it, and recently just watched it again since it was free on TV. The second time felt just like the first...it was OK.
