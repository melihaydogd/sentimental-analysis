Feeling good? No.
A simple story you soon forget. I am surprised over the buzz around this movie, and can not really understand why it got so much credibility. The actors are good but that is not enough. For me this is a shallow film. Feel good? Not really. Anti intellectual movie, a really simple story about two men in Paris. Things like art, classical music & opera is boring. Drugs, tobacco and soul is good. I have read some of the other reviews published on IMDb and may have expected to much (and thats never good) but even so, the story was to easy. And what happened to the daughter? To many lose ends, to much fluff for my taste. So I am sorry, low remarks from me.
