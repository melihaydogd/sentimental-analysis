Great movie, not so good musical
I will probably get a lot of hate for saying this, but this was not the musical pleasure i had hoped for. While the plot and movie in general was great I thought they could have done so much better with the music. They replayed the same song over and over again so much it annoyed me. Yes I know it was their song and it was romantic, but it got to a line where they almost didn't care for any other song. There were a few songs, maybe 2-3 that really told a story and moved the story forward, the rest were happy pills where they danced for 10 minutes or played the same song. The story was great, I loved it, but I wish they musically could learn a thing or two from movies like Mamma Mia and Dreamgirls.
