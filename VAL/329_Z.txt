Beware the wrath of the fan-boys
DISCLAIMER: I did not watch the TV show before I watched this movie.

I thought "The Last Airbender" was an OK popcorn movie. The settings and special effects were pretty good. The big fight scenes didn't really hold my attention but at least they didn't drag on for too long. The characters were interesting. The acting, particular the kids, was not going to win any awards but was passable.

Some reviewers say the dialog is clunky with too much exposition. I didn't notice that. In a fantasy film, you have to explain more than in a real-world drama. I was able to follow the narrative without having to watch a second time. I understood the motivations of the characters.

It's a shame that some people's obvious love of the TV show has poisoned their enjoyment of this movie. They don't seem to realize that different media call for different treatments of the same story. This film is subtitled "Book 1 Water" so I assume that it covers the same material as the 20 (!!) episode TV series. Obviously a lot of scenes and character development were left out of the movie script - you can't fit an elephant in a mini.

This won a Razzie for worst film - seriously?? To say this is worse than "Sex and the City 2" or "Twilight Eclipse" is absurd. Take a chill pill fan boys and girls. Nobody's stealing your precious memories.
