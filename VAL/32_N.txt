Not Scary
This movie was so so so retarded....it was hardly considered scary... a doll kills people, please how much more stupid can it get...? I don't think that the sequels were that scary either...maybe if they didn't have him come back to life every time he was killed it might actually make some money and actually be somewhat scary. The Seed of Chuckie was the least scary...Britney Spears? Well whoever wrote this movie has some serious problems...at first I used to be so scared of it but then it kinda hit me that it was retarded because it's not realistic at all. Maybe they should make a reproduction of this movie...a scary one... until then I guess I'll just have to live...
