A bug thing
From the director of The Sixth Sense, M Night Shyamalan. Here is a big budget science fiction film based on a story by Will Smith.

Father and son Will and Jaden Smith team up to play a militaristic father and son from a planet called Nova Prime.

They crash land on the planet Earth a thousand years after the people there were forced to leave it. Contained in the ship was a blind predatory creature (Ursa) that hunts humans by sensing its fears.

With Will Smith's legs broken, the young Smith must go out into the now scary landscape to retrieve a beacon that will allow them to make contact with their own world.

Will Smith plays the legendary Ranger, General Cypher Raige who discovered ghosting. An ability to suppress his fears so the blind creature cannot sense him.

His son Kitai has tried to train to become a Ranger just like him. However Kitai is haunted by the death of his sister from the Ursa and it seems Cypher is also affected by the death of his daughter.

The action then takes place on Earth where plants, birds and animal life has evolved in the intervening thousand years. Monkeys are big and vicious, birds are enormous, snakes can do acrobatics and there are some tiger type creatures that go after bird eggs.

It is unclear why the humans needed oxygen pills when monkeys were doing OK, as well as why is the planet is still regarded as a danger when the new planet has the Ursa terrorising them.

The story never really gets exciting. Your attention wanders because it lacks excitement.

Will Smith who started out as hip and brash is so subdued he will drive you comatose. For most part of the film he remains injured.

This leaves his son to carry the film, hindered by a not to good and predictable script he is just adequate but not strong enough to carry the film despite a decent outing in The Karate Kid remake.

Being a M Night Shyamalan film, do not look for a predictable twist, there is not one but here is a filmmaker that maybe on a decline after showing initial promise.
