So boring it annoyed me

Memento started out well, I was enthralled for the first twenty minutes. The next twenty minutes I found ok, the twenty minutes after that I started to get bored and after that I just wanted the film to end. No I did not get the ending before the end reel but by that time I didn't care, it had turned into a matter of wills, which would break first my will to watch the film or my will to say to a friend that this was the most boring piece of s*** I have seen in ages and could he please turn it off. The former won, but I felt tha I had wasted two hours of my life which I cannot now get back. If you want a film with a good plot twist watch The Usual Suspects, if you want to watch a film and then be able to say well I'm a real fan watch Memento. Watching Memento and saying it is wonderful isn't a case of watching interlectual film its a case of thinking you are watching a interlectual film, whilst in fact you are watching second rate tat which isn't smart or clever.
