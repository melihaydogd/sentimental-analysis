Stallone Ruined The Rambo Franchise With Last Blood
Let us review on how the Rambo franchise went through the first four films. The first film -&quot;First Blood&quot; - was a great opening as we get to meet John Rambo,a Vietnam War veteran who apparently is suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) brought about by his war experiences that he gets an unfriendly welcome in the country that he served. The second film -&quot;Rambo:First Blood Part II&quot; was a good sequel as it explains Rambo&#39;s war expertise and a movie that provided a morale victory to the viewer particularly Americans as it presents Rambo becoming successful in a reconnaissance mission of rescuing prisoners of war at Vietnam. The third film - &quot;Rambo III&quot; - provided another reconnaissance mission for Rambo in aiding the Afghan rebels against the Soviet Union which also served as a personal mission to rescue his military superior,Colonel Trautman. The fourth film -&quot;Rambo&quot; was a great film as we get to see John Rambo just wanting to live the rest of his life in Burma until he meets Christian evangelists that he rescued gave him hope and optimism in life. The ending of seeing him get back to Arizona was a great closure. I felt that Sylvester Stallone should have ended the Rambo film franchise at this point .<br/><br/>But then,&quot;Rambo:The Last Blood&quot; appeared. The released of the fifth Rambo ruined the franchise and it just provided a poor send off to John Rambo. What made this film falter?<br/><br/>First,the film is apparently far from the first four films. In it,we see John Rambo living with a surrogate family particularly a daughter that wasn&#39;t given any explanation at all. This part of the story was underwritten particularly on why he particularly have great love and affection for a surrogate daughter.<br/><br/>In addition to that,we don&#39;t see Rambo as a soldier nor a guy who is bothered by his PTSD. Instead,we simply see him in his geriatric age whom we barely remember by his war exploits. The only thing that movie did was to provide flashbacks from previous films. With these characteristics, the typical Rambo fan won&#39;t view this as a continuation of the fourth film. It was more of a revenge drama rather a soldier on a mission or a military veteran who is traumatized by his war experiences.<br/><br/>The poor screenplay was also a big part of it.The plots involved have been taken from other movies particularly &quot;Taken&quot;. One who is a fan of the Taken trilogy would identify Bryan Mills and the viewer would be reminded of Liam Neeson&#39;s character rather than Stallone&#39;s John Rambo himself. Not only that. We also get to witness other points of the story that was inspired by &quot;Home Alone&quot; particularly with the military weapons that Rambo has on his house when he dealt with the Mexican cartel members. Rambo author David Morrell also stated that it was the same as the 70&#39;s B-movie &quot;Trackdown&quot;. Based on the IMDB facts on &quot;Trackdown&quot;, we also see rancher (Rambo is now a rancher in Arizona) who go after a gang (Rambo went after the Mexican cartel) to rescue his sister got abducted for sex traffickers. (Rambo must rescue his surrogate daughter got abducted for sex trafficking as well).<br/><br/>As for the other features of the film, this one is definitely rushed and the story basically was so simplistic.One could also feel that the main character is not John Rambo at all and it would be difficult to relate this movie from the other films of the Rambo franchise.<br/><br/>Too bad that the film tried to squeeze more money into the franchise. It could earn money but it was a poor send off and it definitely ruined Rambo&#39;s legacy instead. Now,we get to see the poorest film of the Rambo franchise.
