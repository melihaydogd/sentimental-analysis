It's good to know that science fiction in the cinema has caught up to where Edmond Hamilton was at in 1939.
I really have nothing but contempt for the Star Wars franchise.  They threw an "A" budget at "F" material and created a juvenile hit which lowered the bar for science fiction in the cinema, aborting the prior ("2001") trend upward in story qualities and thus depriving us of who knows how many *good* science fiction movies.  These days they reach back for sf classics like Heinlein's "The Puppet Masters" or "Starship Troopers", and trash them to the point where little more than the title remains.This is not generally a movie for the fan of adult level written science fiction.  You'll need to look elsewhere for a movie which is.
