Don't waste your money
Saw this piece of crap last month and I have one suggestion for all; don't waste your money to rent this piece of garbage. I really can't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie and have a hard time getting it through my head why it was made in the first place. As a matter of fact, I don't know why I'm wasting my time even talking about such a lousy movie. The main characters acting as if they an ounce of intelligence is not believable. The movie goes nowhere and all copies of this movie should be destroyed.......blaaagh!!!
