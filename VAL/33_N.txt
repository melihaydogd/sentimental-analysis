Most over-rated film ever?

I think this film is a hot candidate for most over-rated ever. It's a run-of-the-mill boxing film, which suddenly turns into a sobbing story of euthanasia, which reminded me most of an afternoon TV drama designed solely to make the viewer cry. Danielle Steele would have been embarrassed. The exaggerated caricature of the girl's white trash family would have ruined a good film, but in this one, I was past caring when they showed up and tried to trick her out of her earnings. They could have had it, for all I cared, if it had ended the film right there. Still, the second part was more interesting than the prolonged and predictable boxing part.

It's a mystery to me how a film with so little finesse, innovation and realism can win so much praise and an Oscar. I almost fell a sleep in my seat.
