I LOVE "stupid-funny" movies!
Unfortunately, THIS movie is only ONE of those things,and it wasn't "funny." 

I guess there's only so much that can be done with drug dealers and a kitten...even if it IS wearing a do-rag. 

I really wanted a small portion of the movie to be at least as good as the trailer, but honestly, I just wanted it to end. And quickly. 

So sad that these talented individuals (the humans--not the kitties) stooped so low as to try to eek out humor in such a poorly presented-stereotypical way. Although Key and Peele were funny when they did their own show, it was painfully obvious that their "THANG" doesn't work for a feature film. 

I really REALLY wanted to like this.
