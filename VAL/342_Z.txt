Over-hyped
The movie was simply put too monotonous/boring in my humble opinion. Sometimes less is more but in this particular case it would have been better if we actually got to see something else than Leo walking around in the snow. The story was also not very compelling which makes me doubt why so many people seem to think that this was a "great movie". I can sum up the entire movie in two convoluted sentences: Leo plays a person who is part of a small group of frontiersmen who are at war with the natives. Leo gets attacked by a bear, almost dies, remains crippled due to the attack for the majority of the movie, watches his son getting killed by a fellow frontiersman while being unable to do anything about it, gets left behind in the wilderness to die (by the aforementioned traitor), seeks revenge, gets revenge, end of the movie.

It was pretty disappointing and totally predictable (the end, that is).
