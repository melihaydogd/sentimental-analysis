Not Scary But An Interesting Watch
I watch a lot of horror and it may be that I am a bit desensitized to what horror is. While it was interesting to watch and it had a couple of creepy moments, I can't say that this was a "scary" movie. I like that this was about Djinn. I don't think there are many movies where the antagonist happen to be Djinn and I'd like to see more films with this theme.This is a well made film and I thought the acting was decent. The fact that this is set in the Middle East makes for an interesting watch as customs and beliefs are different. I would've liked to have seen more character building on the Djinn. There wasn't much describing origins, motives and related phenomenon. It's not what I would consider to be an awesome horror flick but it is better than just average. I probably won't watch it again but I am glad I watched it at least once.
