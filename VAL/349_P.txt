JUST WATCH IT. People with the negative reviews totally missed the whole point of the movie
First of all this is not a horror movie, it's a psychological horror. The point was not to create a scary story or whatsoever, it was more the psychology of the person, the physical loop represents the mental loop, it kinda portrays living a lie and not being to live with yourself until you finally break free.. The dialogue is probably not the best out there but it was not stupid and empty either, more of a decent regular dialogue, but other than that I really enjoyed the movie it kept me interested and glued to the screen, the twist was there, the suspense was there, the cast is amazing and the aesthetics are beautiful (especially the choice of the house, if you actually dig and look for that house you will realize that the choice was smart).. I could go longer about this but just trust me when i say, if you're into superficial horror movies this movie is not for you, if you enjoy psychological horror and interpretations then go ahead and watch it !
