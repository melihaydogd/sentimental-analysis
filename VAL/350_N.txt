Real review from a grown adult
I like Saul but, Im not giving this a 10 for that reason. This movie is slow and boring. I wound up fast forwarding just to see the end. It had good parts, the bus scene is really cool but, it's just so boring. Really, nothing happens for loooong periods of time. Really cool seeing Saul do something else and seeing Dr Brown from Back to the Future was cool but, still like watching a snail cross an 8 lane highway.
