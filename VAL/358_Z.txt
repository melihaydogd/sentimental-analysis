beautiful but slightly disappointing
I saw KFP last night and i when i left the theatre, there was a weird feeling in my stomach. That feeling was disappointment due to the lack of laughter. I watched the entire movie with a smile on my face, so it was enjoyable but not hysterical, i never broke out in laughter like i did with other animated movies.

This movie has something special and that is the magnificent animation and the spectacular fight scenes, that will remind you of "crouching tiger,hidden dragon" and "house of flying daggers".

I went to see it with a friend of mine and we both love movies. Afterwards we love to discuss what we saw and re-enjoy the best moments, but you could have heard a pin drop. We couldn't find anything to mention that was memorable to say besides our admiration for the beauty and eastern style the movie was crafted in.

So in conclusion: If you want to see an animated Kungfu-film, KFP is great. If you expect to see a funny picture about a panda doing Kungfu , KFP is very mediocre.
