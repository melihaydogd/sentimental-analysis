I stop watching the movie after 5 minutes
I want my 5 minutes back!.The same old (...) let's say "thing". In a middle of the war, he continue to play on the piano, when in real life, a ordinary person will run like a dog race. He even give as a smile on the staircase when he meet that lady, while behind him the bomb explodes. "how touching"! lol don't care about the rest of the movie, i had enough. The funny thing is that i have to write 10 lines of text to be published, and i have'n got that much to say about the movie. Wait, i have to apologise for my English, i'm not a real English citizen, i'm originally from Romania, country where you don't get the money back for a bad movie. lol Here, 10 line of text lol
