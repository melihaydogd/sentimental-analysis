One of the genre's undisputed classics
Managing to find a popular toy for her son, a woman gradually comes to believe he's inhabited by the soul of a serial killer and tries to get a policeman to believe her in order to stop the doll from putting his soul into her son.

Overall this one turned out to be quite impressive and truly enjoyable effort her. One of the film's best features here is the fact that there's just so much done here to make it questionable whether or not he's really possessed or whether the whole thing is in his imagination, a fine product here that carries itself for the whole first half. By focusing so nicely on the these elements, the scenes of the two blatantly disobeying parental instructions in order to follow his directions instead, the constant appearing around the scenes of many of the accidents all innocently and never believing anything he tells them sets this up rather nicely here into her investigation of the whole affair which is where this one really picks up here by letting this here carry the main part of the film. While the revelation sequence is truly legendary here as the earlier investigations give it some intriguing possibilities about what's going on, the battery discovery of all kinds of chilling, the initial reaction is priceless and then the ensuing attack after being threatened makes for a superb, stand-out sequence. Even along these other scenes, there's plenty of other fun to be had here in the film's fun action which are highly enjoyable and make for quite a thrilling time here, from the opening stalking scenes in the toy-store before finally getting to the transfer ceremony as the lightning bolt destroys the store in a giant fireball, a alter stalking scene at the friends' house where he sets the explosive trap that blows up the building and the absolutely fun car chase as another trap inside the car provides some thrills while making a fine set-up for the stalking within the flipped car at the end getting some fine suspense in. As well, there' an absolutely ton of positives to like here with the final stalking in the apartment being the true highlight that features a ton of high-energy action as he charges after them continuously despite being set on fire and having his limbs blown off, the different brawls and overpowering attempts make for quite a nice time and the whole thing comes off flawlessly. Lastly, the film gets an absolute ton of positives from the stellar special effects work for the doll, as this is an absolutely amazing part of the film. Given that this one spends as much time as it does here showcasing him on-screen, it needed to come off flawlessly and he manages to come across as a realistic doll, and the puppets achieving this throughout here are marvelous due to these perfectly conceived creations. These here manage to hold this up incredibly well here as there's not too many flaws here. About the only thing really wrong here is the fact that her investigations take up a lot of time here and somewhat stalls the killing done by keeping the doll off-screen here, though none of this is really boring even detrimental. This one is quite fun regardless.
