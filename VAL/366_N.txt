Mostly well acted but badly written and directed. High reviews reveal how low expectations of audience are.
Started very well I was interested in the story of discovery. But this is a poorly written story beneath the quality of the actors in the film. The pace is too slow after the beginning character development. Well acted, except for the lame and vastly overdramatized social message inserted as the film goes on with Lily James character and her husband. Had the story concentrated on the history, and the archaeological importance as well as how the basic characters involved it dealt with those issues, it could have been good. As soon as the obviously politically pandering sexual element enters the film, it becomes aggravating and foolish. The relationships that are affected by this are not believable, cheesy, unbelievably melodramatic, and the chemistry is just not there. I wish people could just write a story without inserting social and political propaganda and messages. Such a shame, it could have been good.
