Solid performances, very little story
I will keep it short, because the movie's plot is so "concise" that you cannot discuss it without giving it away.

Basically, it's 90% Jake Gyllenhaal playing a tightly wound weirdo, who clearly seethes with rage just below the surface. He is excellent at this, but that is really the whole movie. Renee Russo is also good, but her role is very secondary.

As the info sheet on the movie says, he becomes a roving cameraman, shooting crime scenes, and that's about all that happens. There are some scenes that show the lengths he will go to to make it, but that is about it. There is a purported moral lesson in the movie, which boils down to all the American viewer wants is blood and guts, not news. Not exactly the biggest revelation.

So Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent, Renee Russo is good too, but barely in it. So if a full movie of Jake Gyllenhaal doing a wound too tightly psycho, a la Anthony Perkins, is your idea of a good movie, this is for you.
