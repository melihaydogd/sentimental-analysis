Great Movie, More Thriller than Horror
After waiting to see this movie for over two and a half years, I wasn't disappointed with the end result. I wouldn't call this a horror film as it's described online but there was a few times when I felt creeped out while I was watching. Considering the fact that this film was supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy, the director did a really good job with fixing up all the loose ends so it wouldn't end off as such. There was good character development, good action sequences, with comedy bits and touching moments so overall good film. I also liked how they made references to the Fox X-Men Universe, which to me, is important in a film series. However, I do wish it had more jump scares and creepy moments which is why I deducted a point. Who knows? Maybe they had to cut lots of it out due to it being given a PG 13 film rating. Either way, if you're a fan of the Fox universe of X-Men, I'd recommend this film!
