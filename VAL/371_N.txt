Sorry to disagree...
I&#39;ve seen (and thoroughly enjoyed) every Pixar film - even the shorts - up until now. I was excited to see Ratatouille - as was my daughter who has devoured all the previous Pixar films via repeated, satisfied viewings. Ratatouille is horrible. My daughter was so bored that, while normally rapt with one of these movies, half way through she didn&#39;t want to watch it anymore. She hated it. And I laughed twice in the last 10 minutes and maybe once before that.<br/><br/>It&#39;s just not that entertaining. Please be prepared to look beyond the hype and see a film thats entertainment value comes from it&#39;s maker and not from it&#39;s story. If this was anyone but Pixar, it would be getting trashed.
