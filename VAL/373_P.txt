Beautiful
This film is the single most romantic film I've ever seen. It tackles their love in a dream like way, where everything goes perfectly for them. As it's part of a Trilogy between these two lovers, this makes sense. It's my personal favourite of the Trilogy as its tone is brilliant and you feel like you are with them every step of the way. Thanks to the fantastic writing, you get to not just watch these characters fall in love, but fall in love with these characters. It's a brilliant, brilliant love story.
