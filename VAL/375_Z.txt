Stupefyingly dull
"Fast Company" would be a dull movie anyway, but having been directed by the acclaimed David Cronenberg makes it an inexplicable disappointment. There is very little action, and what action there is mostly elicits yawns; either the sport of drag racing is uncinematic, or Cronenberg fails to make it cinematic (the only big stunts, at the very end, are spoiled by sloppy continuity). The story is nothing worth mentioning, and the long scenes of people fixing cars and the even longer scenes of people getting in and out of cars or the scenes of planes taking off and landing are mind-numbingly dull. It's also a shame that Claudia Jennings' final film role turned out to be so insignificant. Even if you are a Cronenberg completist, watch Burt Reynolds' "Hooper" instead - it does this sort of thing much better. *1/2 out of 4.
