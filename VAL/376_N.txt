Outdated love film from another century
Stupid, predictable and dull are three keywords that sums up "Kyss mig" better than most other words. It's a love film about two women. One being openly gay while the other is engaged with a man. The only thing separating this plot from one million other love films is the two main characters being homosexual. While it's great that main characters have other sexual traction than just being straight it still doesn't make this movie anything other than awful. You can't base a movie simply on a sexual orientation in 2011 like you could 15 years ago.

I hope that more films will use homosexuals, transsexuals and so on as main characters. But please don't base the whole movie around it. How could homosexuality ever be normalized if every homosexual character and also real life homosexuals based solely on their sexuality.
