An amalgam of cliches
If you're a cinephile, you'll see that every single plot aspect of this movie has been done and overdone hundreds of times in the recent past. The dialogue is incredibly unimpressive for the cast of actors as well as the for their character roles within the film. The predictable very linear plot continued to unimpress as it trudged towards more unoriginal developments. If you enjoy cheap action movies that attempt to have depth but end up shallow, go for it. If you're looking for something fresh and unique, avoid it. It's wasted potential as usual.
