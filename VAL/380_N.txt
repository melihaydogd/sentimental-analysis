 In A Word - Disappointing.
When I asses a movie made from a classic story, I usually go back to a cartoon version of Oliver Twist where the producer, writer and director decided it would make a much better story if they added a talking frog. This wasn't that bad.  I gave it a 2 because it wasn't that much better. I didn't hate it as much as my 13 year old son, but I didn't like it. Part of the problem was probably that we finished reading the book this past week and the better story and adventure was still fresh in our minds. There are problems that I can overlook: Hobbits and Dwarves grow and shrink from scene to scene, There was a gratuitous love scene added, and Saruman promoted into the primary villain (The simple "Bad Guy" is much LESS interesting than the scholar  overwhelmed by his subject, etc).  But the thing that bothered me the most and is really unforgivable was the terrible miscasting of Elijah Wood as Frodo. Since Wood seems to feel that acting means opening your eyes wide and whining, It isn't really that surprising that he, the director and writers have turned one of the more appealing heroes in literature into a total wimp.  The more he whined, the more disappointed I got.  I fear that Frodo is in danger of being remembered NOT as an average guy, with problems and desires and a thirst for adventure, put into an extraordinary situation and prevailing through his own grit, brains and determination, but as an ineffectual Dweeb, paralyzed by situations beyond his control and cringing and whining his way towards his destiny.
