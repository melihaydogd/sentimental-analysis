Outrageous critics
I believe that so-called critics of today have a sense of entitlement to their opinions. Which is absolutely okay on one condition.. know your facts! This film wasn't too terrible, and if you are not a professional critic, than you don't have a right to bash this movie! For a low-budget, Canadian film, it was quite entertaining to watch! So what alot of the mechanical situations weren't accurate. IT'S A MOVIE! Movies are meant to be enjoyed, not to be closely examined of every aspect! For example, Zombies aren't real, but there are still movies about them! I suppose you're going to say "oh this movie is rubbish because zombies aren't supposed to bite arms, they eat brains." People need to quit being tight-a**** and enjoy something fun for once!
