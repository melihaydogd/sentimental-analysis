Simply Excellent
I am one of a rare bread who had not heard or read much about this film. I was captivated from the start - intensely surreal in the best traditional of the genre. Yet almost lyrical. Its setting in deep dark urban Scotland - Glasgow? - augmented the sublime darkness and dystopic undercurrent. The plot was simple indeed - 'survival'. This is quite a special piece of cinema - unlike any I've seen before and far superior to all in its genre and beyond. It certainly a multi layered film. And to merely categorise it as SCIFI, mystery etc. does it great disservice. The ethereal fa√ßade ingeniously weaves together and encompasses the complexity of human experience. The absolute ultimate vulnerability of magnificence to the shear brutality of basest forces in us all.
