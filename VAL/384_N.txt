Pretty dull, give it a miss.
"There is some decent acting by Martin Roach and RJ Mitte mostly, and some really bad acting by some others.

Overall its pretty boring and the dialogue is way too on the nose.

The camera work is decent but I don't understand the comments about the creepy 'mood.' It's just scenes in a bar with two guys telling stories with a wee reveal at the end. Nothing Earth shattering.

It feels a little like a prolonged telling of the hook-handed escaped convict campfire story."
