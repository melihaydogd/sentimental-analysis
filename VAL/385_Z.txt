It's not good. It's merely okay
When they go for dramatic fight scenes it does well. When it goes for dramatic dialogue it falls flat.

No characters seem worth caring about too much, just no depth to them. I like Wesley Snipes in Blade, he played that part well, owned it you could say.

None of these actors own their character, at all.

Okay to pass the time. But when other than a fight scene the acting really sags and feels cold.
