Out of focus and boring
This movie started out well enough, with amazing performances by Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, but unfortunately it gets bogged down by the introduction of various characters and unnecessary and excessive focus on their relationships.

The relationships from those new characters felt like they lacked proper character development, impact, and were completely irrelevant to the dig, and what was discovered.

Also, the discovery itself ended up being very disappointing, and felt like it didn't need a movie made about it at all.

It would have been better if this movie focused much more on the relationship of Edith, and Basil, with everyone else to the side, and the impact of the discovery on their lives rather than the focus being all over the place with several others and their boring relationships.
