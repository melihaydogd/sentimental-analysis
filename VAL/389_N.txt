Boring and unmoving
I didn't hate the movie, but I don't get why everyone thinks it's so good. There wasn't any part of it where I was emotionally touched, and I think it's because the kid was too annoying for me to like it, as a person who doesn't like children. The old guy is sympathetic, but I can't relate to him much as a young person, and those are all the characters that there are...
