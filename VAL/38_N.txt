Incredibly Boring!!
This film is just a monumental bore! I have even conducted a straw-poll amongst my colleagues in the IT System Support Dept and have yet to find anyone who has actually watched/suffered this movie right to the end. The animation may be good but the story is immensely dull and ponderous. I wonder just what is supposed to be the target audience for this movie? My eight-year old daughter found that much of the dialogue was too grown-up for her. Whilst my wife and I found much of it to be down at "cartoon level" and rather too simplistic for an Adult Audience. At least we were able to enjoy watching "Shark Tale" as a family, as it worked on several levels! I heartily recommend "The Incredibles" as a cure for insomnia!
