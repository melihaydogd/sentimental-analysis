Horrible, Boring, Dull, Worst Movie possibly ever made!
I can not believe this pile of trash received any awards. The only rewards it should have received are raspberry! Right from the start, the first minutes were just awful and hurt to watch. Really? Close up of eyes? You call this brilliant cinema? I call it putrid boring trash?!?! Who is entertained by this?!? Anyway, this awful thing had no story, no dialogue, and no plot.. Nothing! A woman running around picking up men to throw into mud?! That is the entire movie! The only positive was the naked body of Scarlett, however she looked awful being a brunette!Do not watch this garbage! Do not believe these good reviews! It will hurt your brain watching it!
