Very bad film.
This film is as much of a let down as "The Phantom Menace" was. The story was dull and extremely unfocused. The pacing was confusing. I'm not sure if it's the actors' faults (Ford and Allen) or the director's, but they were both sleepwalking through the film and seemed apathetic about everything.

Just because this was directed by Steven Spielberg, doesn't mean it's a good film. This was a ridiculous film with a boring story. To spice things up, the filmmakers added campy impossible stunts (deadly waterfalls and vine swinging) to perhaps attempt to shock viewers into enjoying the film intermittently.

Unlike the other Indy films, many of the sets looked like "sets."

To sum it all up: the film was unfocused, dull, uninspired and lazy.
