Overrated
I'm sorry, I know this film is pretty high up in the top 250 films.  I know it has an average vote of about 8, but I just didn't think it was all that good.  It was filled with supposedly touching voice-overs and the like, but I was completely unmoved by any of them.  The point where Willem Dafoe gets killed I though was laughable, and only served to turn the film into some sort of gung ho farce.  All in all the acting was reasonably good however and the direction was good, with some of the action scenes being very confusing and I imagine all the more realistic for it.  All in all, not the movie it is made out to be.  I still think Born on the Fourth of July is Stones' best Vietnam effort.
