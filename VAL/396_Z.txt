Has its moments,but nothing great
This is a decent movie with a funny concept but it could have been so much better if it did away with he really blizzard parts and just stuck to the theme of a lazy slacker in over his head. The whole plot line with Julianne Moore as some weird bizarre sex artist should have been cut. Her acting is just bad.

There's too many scenes in the bowling alley with John Goodman taking over the scenes with his loud brash presence. I forget Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in this but it might be worst performance ever. Hes nothing like the actor he would become and it was disappointing watching him in this.

But there were some funny scenes and it was nice seeing Tara Reid, young and beautiful, before she turned into a drunk train wreck.

The movies definitely an acquired taste.
