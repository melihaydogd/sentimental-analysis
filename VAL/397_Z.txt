Sorry to be a party pooper, but...
it's never explained how Vandamm was able to use the estate without poor Mr. Townsend's knowledge. Why does Thornhill pulls the knife out of Townsend's back as he tells everybody "I had nothing to do with this"? And a photographer just happens to be there when he does? In his quest to rectify the case of mistaken identity, Thornhill assumes Kaplan's name and all but uses his credit cards? THAT makes no sense! Eve deliberately sends Thornhill off to his doom (the crop-dusting scene), yet a few minutes in her hotel room, and - after some barbs at the auction - all is forgiven? Give me a break!

Hitchcock never could shoot mattes or studio "action" so they don't distract the viewer, made worse by the inconsistency in his exteriors (Eve at the plane was clearly shot in broad daylight, even though it's supposed to be late night.) And the Mt. Rushmore sets are so phony-looking. The script repeats information: Thornhill proposes to Eve as they cling to Mt. Rushmore, then calls her "Mrs. Thornhill" as he pulls her up a few minutes later. And Thornhill allowing two thugs to muscle him out of a crowded restaurant without so much as a struggle? One yell for help and the movie is over.
