Show went from great to awful
This use to be my favorite show. It was really compelling early on, but went downhill after about season 3. I see other people's complaints are mainly about Iris. I do see what they say and agree to an extent - this show has quickly evolved into some weird comic book soap opera. The relationships have become really childish. The script sometimes feels like it was written by a team of 15 year old girls. I'd say my biggest complaint, is how stupid its become. The logic has become mind numbingly dumb. Soooo many plot holes. Sooo many inconsistencies. In one episode, called "Flash Time", all the Flashes are running near the speed of light. Then, in other episodes, Flash slips on some marbles and goes "Darn it, the bad guy got away because I fell down. There is no way I'd be able to catch up with them now!" I've forgiven them alot over the years for using dumb logic in their plot devices, in all their episodes , but its become way too much. The writers don't even care anymore about making sense. They've relegated this show to pure stupidity. The crisis crossover has been the dumbest thing I've seen on TV. I mean seriously, in 1 scene, Barry must run on the treadmill to save the multiverse. I use to watch all the arrowverse shows, but I've dropped all of them but Flash, but soon I will be dropping flash. It's obvious their target demographic for this show are 10 yr old girls. It's become 90% relationships 5% dumb logic 5% flash stuff... I mean really, CW, if you're going to make a comic show, why not make it primarily for the folks who watch this stuff? Why target 10 yr old girls? I know people want to hate on Iris, but I'd say she is 10% of the problem. The writers and the showrunner is the main problem.
