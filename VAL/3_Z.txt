Lazy, overly Long, and annoying
It's labeled a comedy, but the jokes just don't land. It can be a thriller at times, but nothing to keep me at the edge of my seat. The drunk blonde who sleeps around it's just lazily written and adds no excitement to the characters personality.The worst of all is the supporting cast. Their performances are awful. I'm surprised it's rated so high. It's not worth your time. Swing and miss by HBO's woke executives.
