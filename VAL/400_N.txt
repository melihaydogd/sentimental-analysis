An average big budget action flick
I was very interested in seeing this movie after the Tim Burton kind of Batman movies. I am not a real Batfan: I don't know much about the comic books and I just expected to see a great "fantasy" movie with interesting characters. Burton's movies were great. I knew that it will be darker now, but it was much more boring. It's an average big budget action flick. The writer and the director has no idea about a SUPERHERO: we got an average action hero of the Nicholas Cage/Steven Seagal type in a bat-suit. However, I haven't seen The Dark Knight movie with Heath Ledger yet and I still hope that it will be more exciting. See my comment there.
