Bothersome and dull
To begin with, I tried liking this film but it was something about it that I just couldn't get past. Was it the typical Internet billionaire treatment, was it the god-like personification of the billionaire, was it the reclusive a typical approach to the billionaire or was it more than that? Well, it was all of that and more. There is this winner of some Internet competition who goes to the billionaire's house and interacts with an artificial intelligence. Now keep in mind that he and the billionaire are suppose to be genius. Well, he interacts with the A.I. and refer to it as her and as people. It is not, it is a machine, an appliance. From there it's all down hill because now he's given it empathy as if it is a living person. Instead of treating it as a machine, he continues on in this vain which inevitably leads to his and the billionaires' demise. Quite frankly, we've seen this scenario in other films way to often with this hackneyed trope. And why would you want to stay in a house that doesn't have any fail safe devices or manual overrides? At the end, I just didn't care about what happened to them because they deserved it and I just didn't care for this film even with the nudity
