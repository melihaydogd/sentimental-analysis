It's OK
Well, they got the basics right: the jokes and the violence were quite what I'd expect when seeing one of my favorite comicbook-characters come to life. I had a lot of fun and the movie had the audience roaring with laughter more than once.

However, the story and the way the other characters were portrayed couldn't keep up with that. It felt like they put in so much effort to make Deadpool really really Deadpool-ish that they forgot how crazy insane his usual story lines are and just used a 'superhero-movie'-template to make something up. I was disappointed by most characters too, apart from DP only Colossus (to my surprise) and Blind Al seemed to have some substance.

Over all, I'd recommend seeing it, but keep your expectations low and just enjoy the fun.
