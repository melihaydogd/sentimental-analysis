Stunning Artwork, but kinda boring.
Pros: An extremely good looking movie with great animation, artwork, and art style. The soundtrack and sound editing were both phenomenal. The voice actors were all AMAZING. And all the characters were really good. All the jokes were funny. Cons: Kinda boring duels that were super short. Villain was uninteresting. Unnece long. Stupid new magical powers.
