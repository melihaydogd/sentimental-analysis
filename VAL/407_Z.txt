Annoying daughter
I really like this show. Its goofy, fun and has some decent villains. I like all the characters, even Iris. But this season has brought in a new character who is ruining the show. The Flash's and Iris's daughter has shown up from the future. I know the acting isn't always the best in this show, but she has taken it to a whole new crappy level. She is irritating, and always has a pouty face. Its literally her only range of emotion she has. Her storyline is lame and again she is the WORST actor. Please........... get rid of her asap. I am really close to stopping watching this show, which is too bad because I've been watching from day one.
