Rumor has it....
Well, I was definitely not the target audience for this movie, but I am sure that any teenage girl who ever felt out of place, felt like an outcast, or ever had any kind of trouble in High School will relate to this movie (or at least parts of it).

The movie is straight forward and very easy to understand, and it portrays the characters in ways that you can easily get into the movie and sympathize for the characters. And hats off to Emma Stone for her performance in the movie, she was simply put, quite good in this movie. And also, Thomas Haden Church brought a lot of color and depth to the movie with his role, as did Amanda Bynes with her role.

I had thought this movie to be another funny teenage comedy, but boy was I wrong. This is far from being just another pointless teen comedy with cheap laughs and shallow punch lines. Obviously, the movie is directed at teenage girls, but I think the movie does bring something out to the viewers, regardless of sex, age and such. The whole movie is built up around rumors, how they start, how they spread, and how they affect the people involved, and it did so in a good manner. And being the Hollywood movie that it is, of course, it had a sassy ending. Not spoiling it here by saying how it ends, but trust me, you will see it coming a mile away.

If you, like me, saw this movie with the hopes of it being a comedy, you will be disappointed. Sure there are moments that had comedy value, but not enough to actually make you laugh out loud, or enough to be labeled a comedy as per se. There is a deeper meaning to this movie, and you will appreciate that fully if you are a teenage girl in High School, or if you were a teenage girl in High School in the past.

Not a bad movie at all, just wished I had known what it was about prior to seeing it, and would have had some type of heads up on it.
