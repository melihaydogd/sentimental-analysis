Oh damn, what a boring flick.
Well, I will be quite brief because there is nothing extraordinary here that needs to be explained, reviewed or analysed as this flick is so boring I nearly fell asleep for a year during watching it. Nothing happens in this latest Blumhouse movie. It is not horror, it is not a thriller, there is no tension or any kind of negative characters, there is nothing here to be reviewed, literally. Shame on you David Koepp, it seems you are getting too old now!

You should definitely skip this one.
