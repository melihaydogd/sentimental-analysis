Pure Entertainment - What Else Do You Need !
Hi All. Where it may be debatable whether this movie needed to be made or not, I have to say only one thing to all those "critics" out there bad-mouthing this film : Get real ! This picture is brilliantly made, is hugely entertaining and visually, as well as sound-wise, stunning.

This picture was made to entertain people, not to be analyzed by wanna-be physicists that probably don't let their kids watch Tom & Jerry because it's unrealistic.

Listen folks, all kidding aside, what are you after when you watch / rent a movie ? You want to be entertained. And that's what you will be ! 100 % Sure, there's tons of CGI, but that's the age we live in - almost all movies are CGI-laden monsters, but that doesn't stop them from being successful.

Please don't be put off by comments you hear or read on this film, it is worth the money.

And the scenes at the end of the film with Kong on the Empire State Building ( I watched this on my home-theater-screen, 10 feet across ) with the city far, far below are simply dizzying. My hands were sweating ! So go and enjoy this film, it'll make for a very enjoyable 3 hours.

That's all we want, right ?!??!
