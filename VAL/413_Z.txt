Why does everyone think this is so great? It's par with Pixar.
Maybe I came in with too high of expectations, but I know I'm not the only one who thinks that this movie wasn't so great. It was just OK. It had funny lines, -all of which were already shown in the previews-, and a pretty good plot, and great animation. But I just don't see why so many people think this is such an "awesome" movie. There was no adult humor at all, so maybe all the ratings are from parents or children, I don't know. I think the 3d version must be a whole different movie than the one I saw, because I walked out thinking it was just mediocre. Heres some advise, do Not watch it if it's not in 3D, you'll probably be disappointed as well.
