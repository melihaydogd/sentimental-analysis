-A one time watch for sure but not a die hard thing.
I thought of watching the film after reading somewhere that it was a rare thought provoking film and should have been a Oscar entry in its time. Well they should have sent the film for the Oscar because at least it is something much better than what was sent at that time.

But the film was a disappointing one. I heard that It was some of the very critically acclaimed ones. But i did not feel it so. The film was not able to explain the very essence of what the director wanted to convey all the time. It is true that the film really portrays what actually happens in the real life. But things should have been twisted a little to suit up the situation. The most shocking part for me was when it became clear that after being survived from the police – siddharth –( Kay Kay Menon) left everything and started to learn medicine. I mean what about all the principles. From the starting he was thinking of very great ideas but in the end it became clear that his wife was much more mature than him. Other flaws the the film would include are no character analysis can be done by the viewer – the character of shiny ahuja seems to be a bit of selfish in the beginning but in the end he was the one to suffer the most. That is OK but what was the need of introducing all his marriage with that girl whose name also I do not remember now. Just to lengthen things up, many characters were being put. The father of Vikram – (Shiney ahuja) was on entirely different philosophy which was good to see but nothing was clear as to what their progress was , either they should not have shown at all about him or if intended it should have been much more analysis. The only character that seemed to be very well suited in the role and was impressive was the character of Geetha – (Chitrangada). She seems to be one of those actresses who know how well to suit into a character, like in "yeh saali zindagi". It was a relief to see him doing her part properly. Kay Kay Menon was impressive as usual.
