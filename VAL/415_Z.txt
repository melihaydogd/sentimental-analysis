Disappointing
I always have high hopes when i watch any movie of Ben Affleck, may be because he has done such amazing movies before you always expect more from him and set high standards for his movies. But this was a complete miss like Batman vs Superman. I don't know how he accepts movies which are so average. I mean What the hell happened to his standards ?? or he must have forgotten to read the whole script.

Anyway the movie is slow paced thriller although you can say a wanna be thriller, which makes you hooked till the end of the movie. End is where the movie completely falls apart and it leaves you disappointed and steals you of your time and expectation for this movie. All the good acting, directing and hard work is gone to trash. You keep saying to your self is this actually the end and you check your watch to know that 90 minutes have passed. Yes it leaves you wanting something more to happen but in the end it leaves you disappointed. This could have been a great movie but the end kills it. Somehow i feel this is similar to the TOWN at least the first 85 minutes.

So Ben, the next time you do chose a movie read the script, especially the Ending!!
