"I have just met you and I love you!"
When Carl was a little boy, he was fascinated with the daring exploits of Charles Muntz, the famous explorer. Then he met Ellie, and she shared Carl's passion for adventure. They had a long and happy life together, but now that Carl is alone, he doesn't want to do anything but be a grump. One day he meets a young scout named Russell and his life changes; maybe Carl has one more adventure in him, after all.I'd heard this animated film was touching, and sure enough, ten minutes into it, I was reaching for a tissue and sobbing. The movie deals with love and loss, and adults who have experienced this may well get more out of the film than children will. It's all about doing what you always wanted to do and it's very good.Ed Asner provides the voice of the old codger Carl and I liked him more than I thought I would. Christopher Plummer is the villain who's not really very menacing at all. The little boy, Russell, is a bit annoying in his helplessness and naivet√©, but Dug, the dog is so adorable that I would see the movie again just for him.While not quite as memorable as Pixar's "Wall-E," this movie will leave you with a smile on your face and a lump in your throat.
