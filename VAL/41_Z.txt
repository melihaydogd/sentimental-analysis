Behold, the most worthless 3D movie ever created.
What started as a very promising career for young director M. Night Shamalan, has quickly turned into a vicious nightmare. How can someone go from making great movies such as "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable", to complete crap storms like "The Happening" and "Lady in the Water"? And no, i will not mention "The Village" because unlike most of you, i actually liked it. Hopefully M. Night can turn around this un-lucky streak and get back to his roots of brilliant film making.

Well, people, here it is in all it's glory. The worst 3D movie ever made. This movie falls under numerous categories of poor cinema. First being the worst looking 3D movie, second being one of the worst all around acting performances in a full length feature, and third being one of the worst child films i have seen in recent memory. Just what makes this movie so bad? Well let's break it down, shall we? First, let's look at the pathetic excuse for 3D. Towards the beginning of spring, i thought "Clash of the Titans" was the best example of how a 3D movie should NOT look. Because if you saw that movie, you know that nothing really stood out. It felt like a waste of extra money because, well, you really didn't get much 3D action at all.....let alone any. Well this movie was exactly the same way, but even worse. At least "Clash of the Titans" had some sequences that stood out. This movie didn't have any. In fact, it felt like i was watching a commercial for a 3D movie instead of actually watching one. Needless to say, it was the biggest waste of a 3D experience.

Second is the acting. I would be very surprised if this movie did not sweep the Razzie awards for acting. My god was it terrible. I don't think i have seen an ensemble act this poorly since last years "Street Fighter".

Third is the storyline. Watching this piece of trash slowly unfold, was like watching a retarded cricket jump all over the place. From start to finish, there was not one portion of this story that stood out, or was appealing. I mean, i know it's a kids movie, but it doesn't have to be told like one.

However, i will not give all the credit to the actors or the cinematographers for this giant turd bomb. I blame the writer/director M. Night. Shamalamadingdong. Because truth be told, i have seen most of these actors act before......in fact, three of them were in Academy Award winning films. They just need to right direction..... and it is clear that they were getting none from this hack. Yes, i called him a hack, because it is almost like the guy has given up being a good director, and you can clearly see that in this pile of rubbish.

Bottom Line, i wouldn't say that it's the worst movie of the year, but it is pretty damn close. This movie talks about elements.....well i cannot find one element of this movie that is worth talking about. This may be the movie that finally puts the nail in M. Night's career. Where most directors get better as time goes along.......M. Night seems to be going in the other directon, because his movies keep getting worse and worse.
