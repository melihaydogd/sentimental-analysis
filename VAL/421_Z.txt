Not the Best Showcase for Cotillard's Considerable Talents
Marion Cotillard is one of the most lovely actresses currently working, and she struggles hard to make something of this blah film, but her talents are mostly wasted.

"The Immigrant" starts promisingly, but it's not long before the film begins to sag under the weight of dull pacing and a relentlessly somber tone. Joaquin Phoenix ratchets up the ick factor to play a man who takes advantage of recently-emigrated women and with whom Cotillard's character strikes up a queasy relationship, not so much because she likes him but because he's the only thing resembling a protector she has in an unfamiliar world. Jeremy Renner is a welcome presence as a rival for Cotillard's affections, but he has far too little screen time and leaves the film too early. Phoenix is absolutely repulsive to look at (as usual) and listen to with his mush-mouthed line readings, and his unpleasantness overwhelms the film and everything in it, including Cotillard.

Handsome production values and some good moments tantalize the audience with what might have been under more dynamic direction and with a different leading man.
