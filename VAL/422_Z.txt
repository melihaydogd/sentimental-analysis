Had Plenty of Action and Humor Throughout
This film involves several different American agencies competing against each other (for various reasons) to get their hands on a replica of U.S. Treasury plates along with $1 billion in counterfeit cash which is soon being carried out of Baghdad and headed to Germany for sale to the highest bidder. Working for the Department of Defense the A-Team consists of their leader, "John 'Hannibal' Smith" (Liam Neeson), "Templeton 'Faceman' Peck" (Bradley Cooper), "BA Baracus" (Quinton Jackson) and a certifiably insane pilot by the name of "Howling Mad Murdock" (Sharlto Copley). Although Hannibal believes that the the members of the A-Team are the only ones capable of retrieving the fake treasury plates they are ordered by DCIS "Captain Charissa Soto" (Jessica Biel) to stay out of the mission which has been given instead to a clandestine organization named "Black Forest". Even so, a CIA agent named "Lynch" (Patrick Wilson) informs Hannibal that Black Forest cannot be trusted and pressures Hannibal to get them at all costs. Needing permission, Hannibal pleads with his superior "General Morrison" (Gerald Ramey) who reluctantly gives him the go-ahead. Things get quite dicey after that. Now, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie had plenty of action and humor throughout. And while the action and special effects were quite extensive I thought it was the humor that kept this from being simply a run-of-the-mill action film. I especially liked the performance of Sharlto Copley who I thought was quite hilarious. Additionally, having a pretty actress like Jessica Biel certainly didn't hurt the film either. Even so, I thought the director (Joe Carnahan) went a bit overboard on the action and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.
