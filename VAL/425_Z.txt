Major Movie Review: Oldboy (2013)
For anyone that has seen the original South Korean film Oldboy and if you know what kinds of movies I dig and love to delve into,than you know that I'm into some twisted, violent, sometimes completely blasphemous stuff. With that I wanna add the 2003 version of Oldboy is one of my favorite foreign films of all time; it's brutal, disturbing, and had great direction but I can go on! Let's save that for a future review. Now, the question here is not why I was let go (ðŸ˜ƒeh?) but how did I like this 2013 American remake directed by the great Spike Lee? Well... JOSH BROLIN'S in it.Joe Doucett (BROLIN) is a struggling advertising exec. with quite the drinking problem, he gets drunk in public, is extremely inappropriate and unprofessional with his clients, and seems to be neglectful of his 3 year old daughter, who's in the care of Joe's ex-wife. During a rough night of drinking, Joe comes across a mysterious woman with a. yellow umbrella, blacks out, and wakes up in a sealed off hotel room with no recollection of how he got there and who exactly is responsible. He spends the next 20 years in his mysterious prison, witnessing world events and his framed murdering of his wife until on the day of his planned escape he wakes up out in the world and sets out for revenge on who ruined his life.Please, check out my full review for OLDBOY (2013) on my Tumblr, link to that is in my InstaBio. Let me know what you guys think. I wanna start a new, more organized rating system similar to how I rated movies in my September movie preview. Ratings will go as ordered: "WATCH THIS MOVIE!" "CHECK IT OUT" "MEH, WHATEVS" "SKIP IT" and "KILL IT WITH FIRE!". I'm hoping you all take nicely to the change. Let me know what you guys think! How about this movie? Have you seen it or the original? What's your favorite remake of a foreign movie?Drop a comment and LETS TALK MOVIES!
