Another one bites the dust!
I heard the movie was bad but still wanted to give it a try. Besides a Queen fan, I am also a huge Beatles fan. I am the kind of dad that gives his 10 year old kids 'The Story of the Beatles' in comic version as a present (and must read for 'general education'). This movie felt like I had just read the story of Queen in comic version. The wikipedia page of Queen translated in Disney style pictures on the white screen with a tribute band and a dental prosthesis as lead actors. Awful!
