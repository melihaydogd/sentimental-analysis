Al Pacino's Great Acting Brightens This Controversial Biography
When I first saw the HBO logo at the beginning I thought "crap this a made-for-TV movie?" I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematography & absolutely blown away by Al Pacino's portrayal of Jack Kevorkian. The subject matter weighs the movie down, however, and no matter what side of the controversy you find yourself on, the scenario is grave. Though I personally haven't decided whether euthanasia is morally right or wrong, You Don't Know Jack will had me rooting for Kevorkian as I was taken alongside him in his thinking and what seems to me, to a genuine empathy for his "patients". After you see this film, you will "know Jack" and it just might change what you thought of him or even what you thought about euthanasia.
