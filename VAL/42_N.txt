Man of Steel is not Superman

If you are a die-hard Superman fan then be ready for a huge disappointment.Not for a moment will you get the overwhelming warmth in your heart when superman saves the day which you got when Christopher Reeve played Superman.This is just another film which lacks totally lacks a solid story and the makers are completely confident that they will fool the audiences again with massive unnecessary special effects(Same goes with Iron Man 3).Lois Lane is apparently more smart than Man of Steel as she somehow manages to be present at all the locations where Man of Steel is about to fall.I came back home and watched the real Superman just to erase this bad portrayal of my favorite superhero.
