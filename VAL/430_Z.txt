Excuse me who liked the movie , but I found it very boring
The Big Short in my opinion is the worst movie of the nominees in Oscar, found a boring movie with slow pace and moments trying to be funny more does not work ( at least for me ) , the cast is a strong point of the film, Christian Bale , Steve Carell , Ryan Gosling , Brad Pitt , John Magaro , Karen Gilian , Melissa Leo , Marisa Tomei, and have a rapid participation of Selena Gomes and other Margot Robbie that and Fri and very good, the direction of Adam McKay reasonable , I found very similar film with the Wolf Wall Street, the script is good, the Big Short in my opinion not work in humor, the performances are even good , plus the pace and slow, the movie is kind of boring with time and dull and unnecessary , besides being much like the Wolf Wall Street (which is very good) , plus the script of the film is even good, plus my view Adam McKay could not use well the good script had.
