Gimme back that Oscar!!!
hi, first I want to state that I am a resident of the Netherlands, so please forgive me for any inaccurate sentences or whatever...

the thing I want to state here is....this movie is a big hype. its not worth the Oscar, because the story in the big lines is just boring and not innovative at all.

maybe it all looks nice, because the coen bros have got a nice reputation and they all shot it with nice atmospheric effects...

of course, there are some nice scenes, which make you holding your breath as if you were one of the partakers in the movie. praise for that! but on the general side, this movie is not worth the big hype it receives right now.

gimme back that Oscar!!! if you like the coen bros, you better just keep on watching your copy of 'FARGO' over and over again, that movie is worth much more the while...

Fargo at least has an interesting story and a challenging plot for many of us...

None such in NCFOM ... its just like a nice violent roadmovie I guess, but I expected a lot more from this...

Maybe in the current field of dull and uninspired big feat movie releases NCFOM might look like something new and spectacular.

But most probably we still have to wait some more before the next movie arrives that really blows our minds....
