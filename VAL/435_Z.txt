I'm sure it was good for the 80's, but thought it was boring
Certainly the most over-rated sci-fi film of our time. OK it looked quite distinct in 1982, and the image of a grim future with giant TV screens high above the city was memorable and somewhat accurate for what we see in todays Hong Kong.

Plot? There's not much to say, the film contradicts itself many times and the weak and limp tale crawls along.

Acting? Ford's OK, Young is pretty and dull, Olmos is cool, twenty years before being cool fighting Cylons, and Hannah is sexy but hopelessly out of her depth.

Apologists for Scott's fiasco blame the evil "suits" for messing up their Lord's film but in truth the directors cut is worse than the original movie.

The sound is badly mixed too.
