Silly fun
Knight and Day is an action-comedy centered on a fugitive couple (Cruise and Diaz) on a glamorous and sometimes deadly adventure where nothing and no one - even themselves - are what they seem. Amid shifting alliances and unexpected betrayals, they race across the globe, with their survival ultimately hinging on the battle of truth vs. trust.

I'm not gonna fool anyone, Knight and Day is 100 % pure formula. It has been done countless times and for the most part, it is corny and campy. At the same time, it's silly harmless fun and that's why I was able to enjoy it. Having said that, with any other two leads, this film would have been absolutely terrible. It works, mainly because Cruise is incredibly charismatic and truly, a movie star.

As in most films trying to be everything at the same time, Knight and Day has an identity crisis. The comedic parts are not that funny and the action sequences, and there's quite a few of them, are not that impressive, specially if you consider some Cruise's previous work. In fact, I would say this is probably one of Cruise's worst films and yet, he's the reason why the film is watchable. Cameron Diaz reprises her role as the silly and ingenious blonde which is basically all she ever does. Peter Sarsgaard has a very small role and isn't even worth mentioning.

Overall, Knight and Day is only watchable. It's one of those pop-corn flicks where you have to turn your brain off if you have any intentions of having a good time.
