Not as good as the original. This one just felt flat. If you haven't seen the original you may like this one more then me though.
"I will get out and whoever you are, wherever you are, I will find you." Joe Doucett (Brolin) is an advertising executive that is struggling at his job and marriage. One night after drinking too much he wakes up in what he thinks is a hotel room. When he realizes that he is a captive and has been framed for his wife's murder he wonders why and who did this too him. Twenty years later he is released and sets out on his quest for answers and revenge. I recently watched the original and I have to say that one was very good but very graphic and had ideas that I was interested to see how it would translate in the US version. This one for the most part stayed pretty true to the original but it was very toned down in terms of the violence it showed. The main difference I couldn't look past between the two versions was that this one came off as very flat. The original had a quality to it that while graphic and shocking made you care about what was going on. This one seemed to lack all of that and I think because it was "American-ized" too much. Even the twist seemed to lack the impact of the original, but I think that may have been because I knew it was coming. Overall, not as good as the original. This one just felt flat. If you haven't seen the original you may like this one more then me though. I give it a B-.
