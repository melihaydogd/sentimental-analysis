Worth the watch I was glued to the screen
The name of this movie sounded like 100 other movies and the cover looked quite ordinary, the movie was another story altogether amazing. I have seen quite a few movies with Orlando Bloom and Forest Whitaker, but this movie in particular their talent in the lens and superior acting skills really blossomed. Zulu was very well directed somehow the director kept the story full of action yet dramatic in a real down to earth way. Like this was a true story. Forest Whitaker and Orlando Bloom made quite an impression on me being they have been in a lot of big hits I thought they might remind me of other characters from another movie. "Not So Here" I have not seen a good movie in a while so this was very refreshing a real gem of a movie. I recommend Zulu very highly, enjoy!
