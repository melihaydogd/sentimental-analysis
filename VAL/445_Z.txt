BEFORE Sunrise Please
I'd both read and heard some really positive reviews of Before Sunrise and was looking forward to it. In large part I also feel there are some special elements to this film - the idea of meeting and being captivated by a stranger on a train and spending one magical, impactful night together, some really thoughtful and interesting dialogue, and an honesty of expression between the two main characters, all good and appreciated. However, I do have one major issue with this film, that it didn't know when to end. Unlike the two lead characters who at the films conclusion know not to force anything or attempt to take things too far, the director unfortunately extend things beyond their natural reaches to the film detriment. I sincerely think that with some prudent editing down this film could have been much stronger. I'm happy for those reviewers that were touched by this film and hold it in such high regard, sadly I am not one of them.
