Heavy-handed
Incredible cast, right down to the small parts. But the film is heavy-handed to the point of ham-fisted, from the opening scene onwards. Mr Spielberg needed to have greater faith in his audience, and let the moments in the script breathe, rather than cutting to yet another brief shot of expository detail. The film is trying to be a kind of parable of feminist empowerment -- Katharine Graham finally comes into her own and she receives admiring and supportive glances from women all over! -- without realising that Katharine Graham was, from the start, smart and tough as hell. This could have been such a great film, if Spielberg had only trusted his writers, his audience, and his cast.
