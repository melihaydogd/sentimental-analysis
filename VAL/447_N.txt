is there a point to this movie?
It's got no plot. It's got no point. It has absolutely no clue how to be funny.

Nothing in this mule has a reason to exist.

There isn't a single clich√© they used that made any sort of sense. The plot is just confusing and pathetic. Did anyone who reviewed this actually NOT be paid to write a good review.

Most of the scenario is in Manhattan so of course, it's unrealistic with massively large apartments and set in the Meatpacking district. Utterly and totally stupid.

Nothing in this movie made sense. Not by any sense of the word. Anyone who says they like it is obviously from Kansas and has no clue what relationships are like.

This is for the Sex and the City crowd.

Stay away. Stay far away from this dog.

Er, sorry, POS.
