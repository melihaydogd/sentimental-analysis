the Simpson's a shadow of itself
the Simpson's once a brilliant show with genius comedy now a ghost and shadow of itself i mean who wrote this movie which i thought was a disgrace and so undeserving to bear the name of the Simpsons the 11 best writers they had (half good like Mirken, Vitti, Meyer Reiss and jean) and half rubbish "the newer writers" (mike Scully executive producer of the show from season 9-12 Matt Selman and Ian Maxtone-Graham the tall one who never even watched the show before joining) i think not. They have missed Greg Daniels (who is still doing king of the hill) Bill Oakly and Josh Weinstein and also Conan O'Brien since they left and should have got them back for the movie plus i really miss Phil Hartmen who did Troy McClure and Lional Hutz they have really missed him since he died.

now on to the movie the plot was rubbish and lazy they used bits from old episode's which hardcore fans will recognise and the use of secondary characters was shocking in my book how can you have a Simpson's movie without Mr Burns doing something evil and other good characters like Barny, Moe, Wiggen and Apu having a part in the plot as they are the funniest characters on the show along with homer who is so unfunny apart from the beginning when pointing at you the true sucker paying Â£6 to watch this rubbish Marge was nag,nag,nag for gods sag Homer hit her that would amuse me Lisa bring boring boring get a life you geek and Bart are you on drugs wheres the rebel Bart from the early seasons who was at least half funny then and not trying to suck up to Ned Flanders who has been rubbish since they killed off Maulde Flanders

to sum this up Matt Groening if your reading this which you are not stop being in denial about the shows decline and do the decent thing and end the show before it slips any further down the line
