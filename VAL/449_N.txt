Just...don't...do this remake thing...subtitles are your best bet
Are subtitles so hard for western audience to utilize? Oldboy is a story told in Eastern ways in an Eastern locale. Specifically Korea; which is unique and also a perfect canvas for this, heretofore, gritty, movie-magic dialog. The original story is contained and extracted there, not here. Chan Wook Park, through total, uncompromising vision, nailed it the first time. To adapt it to a western setting is simply absurd. What's next? A new release of the Mona Lisa in MTV sporting a pierced lip? spandex? See the original. Hollywood has no idea how to conceive Asian cinema. Another dumb-down of great film. Spike, stay continental...Asian is not the new black.While this film does carry some of the drive of the original and has technical quality, it's just a shadow in comparison. Don't get started on the vengeance trilogy Hollywood. Surely failure will befall.
