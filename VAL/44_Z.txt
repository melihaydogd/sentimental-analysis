Average comedy, not good, but not too bad
I had to write a short review of this. Some of the top reviews of this movie is obviously made by someone affiliated with the movie in some way.The movie is mildly entertaining. The plot is the main guy that wants to declare his love for his old girlfriend. The side-story is about an old guy who wants to spread his dead wife's ashes by some shore or other. The side-plot isn't executed very successfully. The acting is OK, although the side-kick gets to be annoying.I was hoping for a few laughs, but I didn't laugh once in the course of this movie. It was a bit funny at times. So I smiled, and that's it.If you have nothing else to do, or if you REALLY like zombie-themed movies by all means see it. You're not gonna walk away very satisfied though.I managed to sit though it's entirety. I'm starting to think that I should have spent it sleeping instead.Goodnight!
