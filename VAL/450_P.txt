I would give "Earth to Echo" a 15 if I could.
"Earth to Echo" is an amazing movie. Before seeing the movie, the trailer made me think of "Super 8" and "The Last Mimzy". I went in thinking it would be one of those kiddish movies, but to be honest it was quite beautiful.

The characters are all so interesting and have a lot of depth to them. Every single one of them has a unique and distinct quality/trait that makes them, them. It's hard to choose a favorite!

The cinematography is so, so captivating. The concept was very creative and definitely keeps watchers engrossed in the film. I just loved all the different camera angles and placements. Most of the scenes were very realistic.

The actors, although young, are exceptionally talented. I found that Reese Hartwig, who plays Munch, was very believable during his more emotional scenes. Teo Halm did an astonishing job at portraying his character- you could just see what Alex, his character, was thinking and feeling. Astro was humorous and gave off a very down-to-earth vibe despite how adventurous his character, Tuck, is. He gave Tuck a lot of depth and feeling. Ella was just gorgeous, and her acting was absolutely amazing. Her character was stubborn and compassionate, and Ella did an extraordinary job at showing that. Very impressed!!

The story is beautiful. I cannot express how much I loved this movie- my heart and stomach ache with passion whenever I think about it. I can't wait to go see it again! Adults and children alike will most likely really enjoy this movie! Humorous but serious and still exciting, "Earth to Echo" is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.

I am in love with the soundtrack of this movie. Every song they played went with the scenes perfectly. It gave the film so much depth and feeling, I actually almost cried during one of the last scenes- the music was just so perfect and beautiful and intense.

I give "Earth to Echo"

15/10.

Definitely a must see for everyone!

((There is a lot of people comparing it to movies like "E.T", but trust me, there is a whole lot of difference.))

Great film!
