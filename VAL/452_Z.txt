Not a fan
This one is an experimental film, and I don't really like the style or aesthetic. I think only a true Beatles fan will enjoy this, or people who are looking for a different kind of movie. I don't listen to the Beatles, I don't like this animation style and I felt the story really boring and trying too hard. I don't recommend it at least you are a big fan of The Beatles.
