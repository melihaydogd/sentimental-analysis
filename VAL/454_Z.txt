On the road with some brats
Nick Persons (Ice Cube) owns a sports memorabilia shop in Portland, Oregon. He has also taken delivery of a customised Lincoln Navigator. Nick is a player who likes beautiful women but hates kids.

When Nick meets the Suzanne (Nia Long) a business executive separated from her husband. He has to deal with her two young kids who wreck any new relationship their mother gets involved in hoping she will get back with their father.

When business commitments leaves Suzanne stranded in Vancouver. Nick Volunteers to bring the children to her. However after lots of shenanigans, Nick has to drive them to Vancouver.

Are We There Yet? is a mildly amusing film with Home Alone lite slapstick. The kids are annoying as hell, no wonder their dad shacked up with a new family of his own.

It is a shame the director never realised how awful the kids were with their pranks. It makes the film look mean spirited.
