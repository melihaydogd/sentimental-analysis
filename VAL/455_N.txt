derivative crap
This movie taught me that Jews suffered unspeakably during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Much thanks for the history lesson -- now how about some good acting? script? plot?

For a movie about a guy who plays the piano, this spends most of it's time showing him walking around and watching bad things happening to others.

I thought this movie was generally a waste of time. Where Schindler's List was poetic, beautiful and touching, this movie was just boring, empty and derivative. Alternating scenes of bland lament and violent, pointless sadism.

If you're looking for a film to stimulate your heart, your mind, and your conscience, look somewhere else. This movie delivers none of that.
