Pointless
This movie was the epitome of terrible. I got the sense when it first started that I missed something. It seriously felt like it started in the middle. As the movie progresses certain new elements, of course, are introduced such as the "darklings" but they never explain in the movie exactly is the purpose of it. Not only that, but at the point when the Caleb starts to finally tell the story of the witches existence to his lover, Sarah, it's brief. He doesn't really say much of anything. FINALLY at the end the main battle the characters are throwing these "invisible balls" at one another. It seemed like the characters were playing supernatural paint-ball. And the coup de grace, the movie ended with no real resolution. This was the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. The only reason I even give it a 1 as opposed to a 0 was because of all the eye candy in it.
