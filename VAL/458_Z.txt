The 22 mins pre credit scene is amazing n cud have been a solid short horror movie. The remaining film reminded me of Angel Heart.
I saw this without watching the trailer or without reading anything bah it. Well, the pacing is its biggest issue but the movie is complemented with good acting, good lighting and a moody n surrealistic atmosphere.The movie is captivating n creepy at times.The first 22 mins is amazingly shot with oodles of atmosphere n some creepy stuff.At first i thot this might be another stupid Candyman n Boogeyman rip off like Bye Bye Man, Slender Man, etc.
