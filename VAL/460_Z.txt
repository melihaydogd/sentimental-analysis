Ruined by it's last half hour
This was an exciting chase/suspense/character movie until about the half way mark. At that point, too much was going on, all of it similar and all of it almost beyond comprehension. There seemed to an endless supply of Mexican drug runners be to killed. Where they came from, with whom they were affiliated, what they were trying to do, were all insufficiently explicated-if at all. The end of the movie is, IMHO, just a disintegration-as if all the money or film stock ran out. Some attempt is made to present the point that this film is an existential exercise showing what I would call nickle and dime existentialism.

Yeah, yeah, we're all going to die. evil exists, life is a coin toss. This philosophizing didn't help.
