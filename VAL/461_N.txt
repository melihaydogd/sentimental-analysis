Now I Know What "Truly Awful" Can Mean
A group of young filmmakers enters the Amazon to film a tribe for an educational film (like National Geographic would). This becomes impossible, but their luck is looking up when they meet a local snake hunter (Jon Voight) and decide filming him might be even more interesting. But the anaconda (at least in this movie) is a creature more ferocious than even Voight can handle...

Today I found evidence that Roger Ebert smokes crack cocaine. While usually his opinions are on the mark and I can see where he's coming from even when I differ with him, this time he was hitting the crack pipe. Three and a half stars? And a praising review? For "Anaconda"? I'm sorry, but you can't pay me enough to find something nice to say about this film. I might say it's so awful it's almost good, but that's not even true. It really is just plain bad.

The plot is weak, the pacing is horrible. No music to speak of. Decent scenery. Amateur director (Luis Llosa), and it shows. A cast which boggles my mind. Someone thought a good cast would include Ice Cube ("Ghosts of Mars") and Jennifer Lopez ("Gigli"), not to mention Eric Stoltz ("Mask"). Owen Wilson would be great comic relief, but he's playing a serious role. Jon Voight has an Oscar on the back of his toilet, why is he in this movie? And is Angelina Jolie going to be as ugly as him in ten years? The other great actor, Danny Trejo, has such a small part I guarantee you won't notice him. Most of these actors can be good in their own films, but together they're a hodge-podge of wasted talent.

If the movie is bad, we can rely on the horror movie villain, right? Not this time. The "magic snake" swims and flies, is an obvious cartoon, and does things to his prey that are either funny or just stupid -- not scary. In one scene, where he appears more like a robot instead of a cartoon, he attacks a robot-like cat that looks like he's an automaton that escaped from Chuck E. Cheese.

In the ultimate irony, Jennifer Lopez's character says, "This film was supposed to be my big break. Now it's just a big disaster." That really summed up my thoughts on her role. Another character said, "The last time I was in water like this I was up all night pulling leeches off my scrotum." Trust me, he enjoyed the leeches more than I enjoyed watching him in this.

If you want to watch a movie about anthropology students getting attacked in the rain forest, rent "Make Them Die Slowly"... plenty of cannibal action and real terror. Don't let your friends trick you into watching horse apples like this film. The only cure for this is intoxication. Not recommended! Do not see! You have been warned!
