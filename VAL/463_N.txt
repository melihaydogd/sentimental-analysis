Entirely Mediocre

I have absolutely no idea why people rate this movie as highly as they do. Not only is Pearce's acting altogether wooden, the "try" level here is so over-the-top and self-conscious it's pathetic: TRYING to be suspenseful, TRYING to be smart, TRYING to keep your attention, but utterly failing at every point. By minute 30 of this sorry film, my mind had already been wandering for 20 minutes. In fact, I didn't even finish this movie. I skipped to the last five minutes, just to see how it would end, and again, found myself yawning. What a boring, self-important piece if there ever was one. Do yourself a favour and skip it.
