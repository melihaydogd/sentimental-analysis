This movie is very hard to digest/watch/enjoy/appreciate/recommend
I watched the movie against my best judgment to stop watching in the middle. But I wanted to since it was hard to digest Scarlett acting in a movie with full nudity, which would not make sense. It was very frustrating trying to make sense. Perhaps I should have read reviews by other people before watching this movie!After reading few reviews on IMDb I must say it is definitely not for simple people who want entertainment for their buck. In spite of it being sci-fi thriller, it is not like species or predator or remotely close. Who were these aliens; why did they come to earth; why they kill people with no remorse or emotion, that also only male; why they do, what they do? These were few simple questions I wanted to find answer while watching entire movie. The movie was very slow and boring to a point where I just wanted someone to fast forward. But apparently it was not about aliens, but about our society! May be aliens were also trying to find the answer to similar question about us: why we do, what we do?Few Utter boring points: Bike being driven around with no music Scarlet walking on a deserted road with no music Scarlet driving around for quite some time in a van with minimal or no music Scarlet inviting guys inside house in a repetitive mannerIt seemed movie was unnecessarily being stretched. Scenic beauty of Scotland is pretty good. No doubt about that. But movie was not about that. Entire movie could have been summed up in maximum of half an hour. At the end of movie I was very tired while trying to make sense out of it. I was ready to give 0 star for wasting my time completely. But then there were parts of it very interesting when alien is in shock and gives up human form. Over all I will not recommend anyone watching this movie unless you are very philosophical and wouldn't mind exercising your brain, which might turn out to be futile at the end.
