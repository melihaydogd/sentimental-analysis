Over Rated
Film making has improved over the years, and this film is choppy like Death Wish. Alot of 70's films appear grainy, compared to the work done today. This film dragged, maybe it was the mood I was in, but it dragged. I found it slow paced, and not over the top. In the end this is just another movie. 5/10
