Slow Descent into Madness
As someone who simply enjoys movies without calling myself a critic, I'm not sure I really "got" The Lighthouse, and I'm not sure I was supposed to.

On a technical level, this is objectively a very good film. Some kind of old or vintage film must have been used in shooting, because the movie is displayed (at least on the Amazon prime video player) in a very strange aspect ratio. This coupled with the black and white cinematography and the use of lamps to light night scenes gives the film a unique stylistic touch. Speaking of the Amazon player, I think this movie is hurt by it in parts. The compression artifacts make some scenes look like garbage, so if you can watch this on bluray or download a uncompressed version, then that will likely make the film look way better on your screen.

The acting is superb. Dafoe and Pattinson get the only speaking roles in the movie, and when get the chance to flex their acting chops, and oh man, they do. They play the whole gambit from awkward acquaintances to drunken friends to bloodthirsty psychopaths. What impressed me the most was the accents they pulled out. Both Dafoe and Pattinson had to each nail their own individual, esoteric, and weird regional dialect and to my surprise I never noticed them slip up or change accents on any words, Dafoe was a 19th century sailor and Pattinson was a Maine farmer from start to finish. Their performances are what tie together and sell this movie as a total package.

The plot is something else entirely though. The story of the lighthouse is about two men who find themselves slowly losing sanity as they take care of the lighthouse over days and weeks. At the start of the film, the sounds and shots are standard and, I would say, beautiful. The island looks good, and the lighthouse is quaint. However, as the movie progresses, the style of the film starts to get more and more erratic and surreal. Without giving away the plot, things really start to fall apart, and the style of the movie matches what is going on in the plot. In its final moments, The Lighthouse's one climactic moment reaches an apex where the whole movie goes insane: cinematography, sound design, plot, acting, everything; it all reaches a surreal zeitgeist.

If a more artistic and surreal thriller movie is your jam, then The Lighthouse will be a 10 for you. For me, and I think many other viewers, the appeal of The Lighthouse to other viewers will leave you confused and jarred but entertained nonetheless.
