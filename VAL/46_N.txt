Preposterous, Self Indulgent and a little Boring
There aren't many films where I think I may actually walk out but after the 20 minutes but I seriously thought about it. It did get a bit better thereafter though. Character development was poor. Did I care much for the characters... a little. A bit of effort is expended in trying to inject some emotion but mostly it falls very flat.

I saw this film in 3D. Why did I pay a premium for this? In some of the hand to hand fight sequences you can barely see what's happening. The effect being akin to watching clothes going rounds and round in a washing machine. 3D technology appears to be very lacking for fast close action fighting sequences.

The story is weak with action/explosions being the main selling point of this movie.

If you go with very low expectations you may come away feeling it was an OK movie. Unfortunately for me I will lament those 2 hours of wasted time.
