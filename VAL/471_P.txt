I couldn't stop smiling! Not once through the whole movie!
That is, except when I was laughing out loud. The movie is more than that though. It gives us some philosophical and even metaphysical potentialities to think about. "Yes always leads to something good," is the presupposition offered to the protagonist. A true statement, but a trick assertion if one believes EVERYTHING leads to something good. "Let your yea be yea and your nay be nay" means either way leads to something good. Just be clear about what you want. Its being shifty and/or indecisive that leads to confusion and disharmony. Yet, I think this is just the kind of movie that will get people thinking differently, get people to act apart from habit, to see what happens, and get people experimenting with life. This is when we truly live. And I dare say, this is when we begin to have faith.
