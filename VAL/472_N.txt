A waste of time!
It's hard to decide which is worse – Montgomery Tully's inept, wait-for-the-B-grade-pause direction, or his incredibly rambling, disjointed screenplay (spun out from a stage play by Falkland Cary) with its compendium of dialogue clichés. The music scorer has tried vainly to give the film pace and atmosphere, but is largely defeated by the heavy hand of Mr Tully and his cast of largely flat-footed, second-rate players. In fact, it's a shame to find a fine actress like Kay Callard mixed up – if only briefly – in this woefully extended quota quickie. Patricia Roc and Roland Culver are usually featured in much better films too. Normally bottom-of-the-barrel "B" efforts like The Hypnotist don't waste more than an hour of a picturegoer's time, but this one is spun out to an incredible 92 minutes. (At some stage, the producer had mercy on cinema patrons and shortened the movie to 73 minutes, but I and my brother big-city critics were forced to sit through the full-length version). Production values are negligible.
