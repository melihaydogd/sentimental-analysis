If you did not read the book...you may not enjoy it the way some reviewers seem to enjoy it.
I saw this on HBO tonight and I think it was long, tedious, and not that exciting. A 3 hour movie really has to keep it moving and keep things interesting if one is to enjoy it...sort of like Avatar did where if didn't feel like 3 hours had gone by. Dr. Manhattan was cardboard and robotic, OK - I get that he's nuclear-powered and all but his acting was dreck. The only character that really "sold it" in my opinion was the bad guy...I'm not going to say who since that might spoil it for others who read this and may still have 3 hours of their lives that they don't care about wasting. Oh, and Rorschach and a few smaller characters were OK too, but not "special" enough to make the whole movie great. The naked love scenes did not really add to the story, but I guess the teenage boys love those. Since I'm home with a cold and didn't feel like getting up to put in a DVD I was stuck with this, and now I wish I had gotten up and put on a DVD of something else. But I was curious and love action movies, so there you have it.

Bottom line - if you're a big fan of graphic novels you may like it. If you like THIS particular graphic novel you may like it. If you are NOT such a fan of graphic novels, you may find it "nothing special bordering on awful" like I did. 'Nuff said?
