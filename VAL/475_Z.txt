Boring. A visibly dumbed Battle Royale down for kids.
So, after all the hype, I just watched The Hunger Games and really wasn't impressed.It's basically Battle Royale dumbed down for kids. You could clearly see the intent to hide anything that would take it over the 12A/15 certification. Hell even Speed had more verbal and physical violence and that was a 15.I found it boring. The majority of scenes were silence or dubbed over with gently epic music.And, throughout, I couldn't help but feel that the whole moral premise was on par with The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE); In order to be successful, you must pander to socially acceptable rules, the way you look and are perceived are the only factors important in your social acceptance not what you can do. Which, personally, I find disgusting.
