If you want some heavy duty action... Don't miss this one!
Ed Harris is a highly decorated officer and a man with a conscience. And he's had it with the wicked ways of the armed forces. Good man with a good cause? You'll be the judge of that. He only wants $100 million bucks (to donate some 89 mill to the families of soldiers 'forgotten' by the military and some pocket money for himself and his loyal army buddies of course) or else he'll gas the people of San Francisco with VX in no time... Well in 48 hours at least.

Sean Connery, man without identity. Aged man, left to rot in prison cell for stealing FBI boss Hoover's microtapes long time ago. And only man ever to successfully escape from Alcatraz, or The Rock as the former inmates call it. He's the only man familiar enough with the web of tunnels under the prison. When 'offered' a full pardon after being behind bars for three decades, it's hard to say no... And besides, it's his only choice really. They don't like him but they sure as hell need him.

Nicolas Cage, FBI's chemical weapons specialist, soon-to-be-father and a beatlemaniac. A sissy lab rat... But not for long! He's the man when bombs need to be defused. And believe me some mean fire crackers are needed to be defused and fast!

There's the main characters, tho I wish they would have given John C. McGinley a bigger role. Great acting nevertheless. And yes you really _can_ imagine what's going to happen and how it all ends. ;) Lots of dead bodies, wrecked cars, gun firing and explosions. Pools of blood, guts and new creative ways to die. Heheh!

But altho the movie is filled with old clich√©s, who cares?! It's still entertainment at best! The Rock is one of those movies where you can hardly catch your breath, when someone turns on the turbo switch again. ;) Phenomenal non-stop action!

A movie that you can just watch and enjoy and laugh about without giving it another thought after seeing it... _But_ there are important issues in the film if you want to start a deeper conversation. Shouldn't be too hard task to find what they are I'm sure.

I recommend to all intense action lovers.
