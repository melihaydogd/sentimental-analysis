A Beautiful, Striking & Disturbing Film
Since director Jonathan Glazer's early days directing some of the most arresting music videos of Massive Attack, Radiohead and his masterpiece short for Rabbit In Your Headlights by UNKLE he has shown he has a unique vision of what the medium of film can be. Under The Skin is a culmination of all the skills Glazer honed over the years resulting in an understated visual journey helmed by Johansson in a very daring role.Equally beautiful and disturbing, Under The Skin is a film shot over a period of ten years with a minimalist script relying on the viewer to utilize the images shown to fill in the blanks. For a reviewer who has seen a great deal of disturbing films ranging from Sal√≤ to Sweetie to A Serbian Film, this film contained one of the most disturbing sequences I have ever seen - a very passive view of parenting involving a toddler and a family in crisis, brilliantly shot in long sweeping arcs with brief moments of intimacy that drive it all home.A very slow-burn film that leaves you stunned in a deep, metaphysical way. Highly recommended for those viewers who appreciate the subtlety of film and the artistic use of the medium as a means of challenging conception and the status quo.
