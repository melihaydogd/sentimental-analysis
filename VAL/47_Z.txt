Quarter Inch Pace
It's a little different I'll give it that, but.... that doesn't mean it's good. It tries real hard to be edgy, but really it's just pretentious. Pattinson is fine with what is given to him, but his character is not interesting in the least and just comes off as a rich brat, who is inferior and less interesting than every other character he comes in contact with.

Now to be fair, I have not read the book, so I just may not connect with the film. I liked Kevin Durand and Paul Giamatti, but both of their screentime was quite limited.

I see that the film is trying to make the audience see the world from a certain point of view, and the direction that society is heading. I'm just not buying it. So if anything it's interesting as a whole, and at least makes you contemplate on society and its current state.

The pace of the movie is quite similar to how the traffic was described within the film; moving in quarter inches.
