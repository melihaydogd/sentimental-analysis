A Fun Action Flick!
Based on the television series of the same name created by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell, 'The A-Team' is A Fun Action Flick, that entertains till it lasts. Its strictly a popcorn fare, that dazzles in explosive action & a fine cast.

'The A-Team' Synopsis: A group of Iraq War veterans looks to clear their name with the U.S. military, who suspect the four men of committing a crime for which they were framed.

'The A-Team' begins engrossingly & maintains the pace pretty well. However, the last 40-minutes are lower on excitement, as the narrative gets extremely predictable at this point. The climax also doesn't have the punch, but the action keeps you glued.

Joe Carnahan, Brian Bloom & Skip Woods's Adapted Screenplay is fun, but it could've been more clever. Carnahan's Direction is good. Action-Sequences are simply WOW! The stunts are exceptionally executed! Cinematography is richly done. Editing is okay. Art & Costume Design fit in. Production Value is superb!

Performance-Wise: Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper, Quinton Jackson & Sharlto Copley excel. Copley & Neeson, especially, play completely to the gallery. Jessica Biel is average. Patrick Wilson does nicely as the villain.

On the whole, 'The A-Team' is quite a ride, despite some faults!
