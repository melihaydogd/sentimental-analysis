The flip side of freedom
In &#39;Room&#39;, there are lots of things we don&#39;t see. We don&#39;t see how the lead character, Joy, is raped by her abductor who keeps her imprisoned for more than five years with her little son Jack. We don&#39;t see how she is liberated by the police, after she manages to let her son escape. We don&#39;t see what happens to her abductor and rapist.<br/><br/>The director doesn&#39;t show all these things, because they distract from the theme of this movie: the way mother and son cope with their freedom. The surprising thing about this film is that this freedom turns out to be rather problematic in a lot of ways. Even so much so, that Jack starts to long for the intimacy and the routine of life inside the shed he called Room.<br/><br/>The film shows how life in Room is claustrophobic, but also intimate and familiar. There are no unexpected developments in Room, but there is a lot of love between mother and son. Once they escape Room, everything changes. For Jack, who has never known a world outside Room, this is very threatening. He has to share his mother&#39;s attention with other people, he has to get used to all sorts of impulses, he has to learn how things like a telephone work.<br/><br/>In this film, there is only one major dramatic event: Jack&#39;s escape and the subsequent liberation of his mother Joy. The rest of the film is rather uneventful: at first we see Joy and Jack in their daily routine in Room, and afterward we see them cope with all sorts of problems in the house of Joy&#39;s parents. Still, the film is almost never boring. The psychological developments make up for the lack of real action. And although there quite some emotional scenes, the director didn&#39;t make an outright tearjerker.
