"Do-oh"n't miss out
Having not seen this movie since my second viewing in 2008, I thought for The August Rush pop this one in and see it again because my memory was foggy on this film. The Simpsons Movie is a lighthearted, fun movie that never bores and has something happening every second. Homer is surprised to find that a bunch of "giant suckers" paid to see a movie like this when it will come on TV for free. The Simpsons have ran for currently twenty one seasons, producing over four hundred episodes and have a merchandise line as long as The Great Wall of China. With action figures, dolls, slippers, posters, apparel, an Xbox, DVDs, VHS tapes, Blu-Rays, and now a movie to go along with, The Simpsons are in good shape to a possible 30th season and maybe longer.

The Simpsons is probably one of the only classic animated programs on TV anymore with others like South Park and Spongebob Squarepants. No show has ran for as long and has had so much publicity like The Simpsons. Not being the biggest fan of the show, but having seen various episodes and possessing knowledge of the show I knew I had to see this. I wasn't surprised a movie of the yellow family was made.

The film is something that couldn't be cut down to a thirty minute show. Springfield Lake is already in trouble with pollution, but gets worse after Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger. To store the pig's droppings, he gets a big silo labeled "Pig Crap". Marge tells him to dispose of the pig's droppings and he does so by dropping the gigantic silo into the Springfield Lake causing mad pollution. Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, talks it over with President Schwarzenegger and they choose (if you want to call it that) to put a gigantic dome over Springfield to contain it's severe pollution causing the whole town to erupt in anger to The Simpson Family and forcing them out of the town. The Simpsons find a way out of the town and are on the run away from the EPA.

The film is cute and very energetic like its on its own medicine. Its a fine example of a TV show that has a good film adaptation. One down fall of the film is it's afraid to take risks. While earning a PG-13 rating, we only see three things (language, finger gestures, and nudity) that we would never see on FOX. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut however took numerous jumps that Comedy Central would never allow. It still holds the record for most swear words in an animated movie (with 139 uses of "the f word").

If only The Simpsons Movie took more leaps and didn't have to shade their faces whenever they made a big step. The Simpsons have kept their near squeaky clean appearance on television for more than twenty years, they deserve a couple leaps. Not to say it was bad, just once in a while, everything needs to step up. Also, its a shame that some characters like Principal Skinner and Miss Crabapple didn't get bigger roles in the movie. Some character like them and Chief Wiggum I wish played a bigger part in this movie.

Other than that, The Simpsons Movie is a highly enjoyable animated movie that shows after twenty years on the air, The Simpsons can still bring hard laughs and amusing one liners that are memorable. Seeing this film after a two year absence gave me a boatload of fresh laughs and a very funny plot. The Simpsons Movie isn't just a movie, its an enjoyable animated ride with the family we love.
