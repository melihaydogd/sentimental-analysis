Sheer drivel
The genesis of this film was Jonathan Demme being harassed by the gay lobby after the depiction of the serial killer in "The Silence of the Lambs." The payback was to make a sympathetic portrayal of a gay man with AIDS (BTW, the same lobby tried to bully Mel Gibson after his portrayal of the effeminate prince in "Braveheart" but Mel is too much of a man to be bullied)   This film is extremely preachy and politically correct---as someone noted earlier---the heterosexual white men are the evil crucifiers of the gay guy. And who comes to the rescue? the black guy. Puhleeese.   The gay party scene was pretty sickening. And by the way, why doesn't Hanks' "partner" have the virus?   I noticed that the GLAAD people have posted like crazy that this is the best film since "Citizen Kane." I also noticed all the usual Hollywood lefties (or should I say "fellow travelers"?) particpated in this film: Joanne Woodward, Tom Hanks, Mary Steenburgen, Bruce Springsteen. I guess Ed Asner, Mike Farrell and Jane Fonda weren't available.   Demme should stop the politics and get back to entertaining people. As the L.B. Mayer said "If you want to send a message, go to Western Union." I'll give a '3' mostly due to Hanks' performance.
