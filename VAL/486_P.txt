Crystal Clear
Economic, specific, brilliant. That should be enough to sing the praises of a work of art but in "The Post" there is more. much more. We can't ignore the fact imposed by the historical moment we're living right now. The press under attack. Belittled, insulted but not ignored. No, never that. Steven Spielberg puts everything at the service of the story and the magic stroke is Meryl Streep. She creates a real life woman again, after Margaret Thatcher, Julia Childs, Lindy Chamberlain and once again she creates a fully fledged human being and this time she plays a woman without a known voice until she finds it and when she does, she uses it. I'm absolutely transfixed and moved very moved by her performance
