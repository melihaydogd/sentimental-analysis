Dumb, dumb and dumber.

This Mad Max is supremely surreal/Dali, absolutely fascinating even. This one, like the first 3 films, we get to suspend disbelief as the movie projects, thrusting us into the post-apocalyptic world, with anthropological and sociological elements we could believe it. Don't get me wrong, this movie is the best of the series, the unforgivable. Mad Max and The Road Warrior were convincing in it's tribalism, brutality and uncompromising violence I'm sure is true is burned into my survivalist memory. I'm not a hater, but massive dune buggies, rock playing mutants and an oxygen breathing madman? No way. Miller, you messed up bad. What happened to Max, a "shell of a man" who hasn't quite lost his humanity, only long forgotten and buried it. In this way this movie pisses me off, in the same way "The Phantom Menace" did. And yet, 9 out of 10. MILLER, you'r awesome!!!
