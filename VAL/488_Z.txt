Hmmm...
I just saw David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis and I have no idea what to think of it.

Cosmopolis was advertised as being 'almost unwatchable' because of its literary DNA - i.e. there are too many words in it - and the unity of place, since the story takes place inside a limousine. Well, it is almost unwatchable but for entirely different reasons. The limousine sequences were actually very dynamic and beautifully shot and words are a wonderful thing to have in a film - as long as you use them well.

The problem is the movie doesn't seem to find the right words. The writing was insipid, uninspired and Cosmopolis doesn't have much to say on its important subject matter. I'm not even sure if the movie is pro or against capitalism: Benno Levin (wonderful cameo appearance by Paul Giamatti) was even more repulsive and unlikeable than the young Packer.

Cosmopolis is not a complete failure, though. There are several striking visual moments, the music of Howard Shore and METRIC is brilliant and Pattinson's dazzling good looks were put to great use here. But the final result is simply not good enough.
