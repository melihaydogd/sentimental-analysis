Not what I expected
As someone who loves Showgirls and has seen it at least once a year for the past few decades, this documentary about the film is interesting but a bit too dry for me. Some of the background comments by critics seem to completely miss the mark and I also found it a bit confusing that they decided to add so many random scenes from Verhoeven's films. I do think Showgirls is an entertaining masterpiece, but this documentary isn't all that entertaining, and I would have liked more behind the scenes footage. It has it's pluses, pointing out how Verhoeven's take on the film has changed over time and the negative ways it impacted Elizabeth Berkley's career, but I could have done without the side stories concerning the people who have been affected by it. Worth a watch if you love Showgirls, but as a fan of the movie I was disappointed.
