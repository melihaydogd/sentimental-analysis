Hello Hollywood
This is the kind of stuff somebody thinks up on the toilet. There is nothing remarkable about this film besides how disgusting it is. I can not help but think a more subtle approach would have helped this movie avoid the banality of the special effects, which seem more suited for a science fiction due to their over exaggeration.The story is overly contrived. The director handles this movie in such a way that the narrative jerks from one scene to the next, yanking us to a punchling serving as a climax. Something so obvious and derivative is not worth watching.Overall I felt the movie was very disengaging and fundamentally simplistic in narrative. The characters are clich√© and I found the general atmosphere of the film undesirable.
