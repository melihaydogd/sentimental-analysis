Overrated
Several people recommended this film to me and I was looking forward to watching it. But I was disappointed.

For a start, I found it difficult to take the hero seriously. That wasn't William Wallace fighting English tyranny. It was Mel Gibson. The film had "Made in Hollywood" stamped all over it, taking crowd pleasing liberties with the historical truth. Crowd pleasing liberties can be forgiven sometimes, but these were just so, well, *corny* is the word that springs to mind.

Good battle scenes though, and the evil king played a good part. But I wouldn't watch it again.
