Frothy fun
Aside from some gratuitous topless scenes and a few double entendres, Gas Pump Girls is a surprisingly sweet little film about five teenage girls, their boyfriends, and a goofy motorcycle gang taking on the big bad Pyramid Petroleum Company in beautiful downtown Sacramento. The talents of old timers Huntz Hall, Joe E. Ross, and Mike Mazurki are sadly wasted, but the film manages to provide 90 minutes of relatively painless entertainment. Even the wretched original songs work in the post-Grease context of this low budget musical comedy. "Ooo wah ooh wah...ooh wah ooh wah...your mother is an ooo wah" indeed!
