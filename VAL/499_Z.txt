Overrated
This movie was good, but I don't know that it deserved the slew of Oscar nominations it received. It certainly wasn't good because of Brad Pitt, he has one of the least expressive faces in show business and it is difficult to actually believe he is feeling any of the emotions the script calls for. Another liability of this film is its length, most of which is spent showing the title character bouncing around apparently trying to find himself, which makes sense, given his circumstances, but it is a very superficial treatment. Finally, his aging process is not actually linear (neither forwards nor backwards), so an already implausible premise becomes even more difficult to buy into. I'm glad I saw it, but it is not the spectacular film people would have you believe.
