A slice of awesome
This movie is by far the most exciting super hero movie yet!

Please be warned, this movie is extremely inappropriate, but an absolute thrill ride. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is the perfect fit. Just when you think he could not get any more clever with his words, he would say the most off the wall comments possible.

The fighting sequences in this were incredibly jaw dropping! Deadpool really is one of the most innovative fighters I have seen. His techniques are totally unorthodox and cannot be matched nor mimicked by any other who dares.

The only thing that was not satisfying is the length of the movie. It was much shorter than expected. The backstory to Wade Wilson before becoming Deadpool is short lived. Despite that, it still was an excellent movie, and I cannot wait for more!
