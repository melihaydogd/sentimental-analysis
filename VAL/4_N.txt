Silly and Typical
I got this as seatback entertainment on a Delta flight yesterday. I found it annoying, uninteresting and laughable at the same time.

It's typical superhero idiocy. Here's the key to this genre. The hero gets the snot beat out of him (or her, I suppose) until either he decides to fight back in earnest or remembers some secret word which causes something or other to happen by majicks.

The thing in question opens with a half dozen cholos stealing the wheels off of the title role's car while he's asleep inside of it. He comes out and nicely asks these fellows to cease. They kill him with a shotgun. Undeterred, he returns to life (?) and then tears them apart with majick talons which majickly appear at his knuckles. See? He's defeated and then gets serious. Predictable in the extreme, really.

So then he goes to some place which looks like south New Mexico to visit with two oddballs Who Have Majick Powers (of course). One of them is the old captain of a Star Trek TV series, Patrick Stewart, who's in a wheelchair. They are attacked by a gang copy and pasted from a Road Warrior movie led by a Bork from Star Trek.

I'm making NOTHING up.

The bad guys prevail because it's too soon for them not to. The captain, the guy with the scary knuckles and some girl who was manufactured in Mexico via a bio lab flee. I liked the movie's paying honor to the highly advanced biotech which does exist in Mexico (in secret).

About 9 hours later (it felt that way) the bad guys find and attack the group again - this time in a hotel casino. The captain then paralyzes them using his Super Power. I gave it up in disgust at this point. If the captain had used his Super Power back in New Mexico, the movie could have ended then.

There's a good deal more that I detested in this mess, but you got my take. 8 stars? This one, other than production values, should be less than Planet 9.
