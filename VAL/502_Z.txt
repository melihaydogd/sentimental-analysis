I'll compare it to a poem
Originally, I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption, but i've decided not to post it.  Instead i'd just like to say that i would compare the movie to a poem that i wrote in 5th grade.  i'm not going to write the poem out because i don't have it with me right now, but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following your dreams. In other words, it was complete b.s. I just wrote what i thought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together, hoping people would like it.  My plan succeeded, the teacher thought it was the best in the class, and it got published in the school newspaper. Seems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont, and the writer of the book, Stephen King, did the same thing.  The movie is technically well made and does succeed at telling the story.  I admit that I got caught up in the ending.  But no matter how much you try to defend it, it's still pure Hollywood.  Cliche here and there.  I recognize this for what it is:  a director's attempt to manipulate people's emotions, which, due to a large amount of naivite in the world, succeeds.  He did the same thing with The Green Mile with more success.  Now, with The Majestic, I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and many moviegoers have recognized this, and given it generally lower reviews than his first two films.  Finally!  Now I only hope people will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down from the heights of the top 250 list.
