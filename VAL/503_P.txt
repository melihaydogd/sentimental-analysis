Why are all these user reviews so bad?
I had to write a review after seeing how many nonsensical 1/10 reviews there are for this film. It's hard to believe any of these negative reviews posted are actually for this film, especially since many of the reviews that reference plot points or characters seem to reference them as absolute unknowns, shedding light on the fact that a majority of the negative reviews are written by people who either did not finish watching the movie or did not even see it in the first place.

Disregard the braying asses with no attention span. Take a seat and watch an actually good movie. Really. It's a movie that's ACTUALLY good. Just WATCH it.
