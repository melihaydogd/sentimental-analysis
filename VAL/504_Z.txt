Mediocre... doesn't deserve all the high praise!
I know there's a hardcore fan base out there for The Simpons, but I couldn't help but feel that maybe this would've been better as a made for TV movie. The gags were nothing special and I only found myself laughing twice throughout the whole picture with an odd chuckle here and there. This was mediocre at best bordering on being tedious in some places (spider pig! Need I say more?). I'm a huge fan of the earlier episodes, which had some really excellent stories that dealt with real problems in a unique and entertaining way. However, watching this only reminded me of the more recent Simpson's episodes which tend to use shock value and tried and tested gags to achieve laughs that can now only be found in the earlier episodes. Deserves 5/10 watch Order of the Phoenix for a really entertaining cinema experience!
