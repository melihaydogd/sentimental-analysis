It's a "guy movie" (says my wife)
My wife and I saw Up in 3D last night. Just us 2 adults, no kids. We have seen most of the animated features in recent years and liked most of them. I thought Up was decent, not great, but OK. My wife HATED it!I agree with pretty much everything *negative* that has been said on this board about the movie, but I haven't seen mentioned the thing that bothered my wife the most: there are NO female characters past the first few minutes! The only female (human) even in the movie is Elie, very briefly as a tomboyish child in the very beginning, then as an adult in a short, silent montage. So by 5 minutes in, it's all guys. I guess the bird was female, but that fact is so far from obvious that she gets named "Kevin" by the little boy. (Maybe some of the dogs were female too, but you couldn't tell.) I didn't even notice the lack of female energy until my wife pointed it out but it's true, and I think it contributes an overall imbalanced feel of the movie.As for the 3D, I thought the scenery was very nicely done, but the overall use of 3D was more subtle than many other 3D movies. I don't remember any "coming out at you" shots at all; most of the 3D images were at or behind the screen rather than in front of it. I think this may be why many have commented that they didn't even notice the 3D. Also there were too many "flat" scenes that might as well have not been in 3D, such as long closeups of items in a scrapbook and long segments of black and white old newsreel style footage on a TV screen.So I'll average my 7 opinion with my wife's 1 and say 4 out of 10.
