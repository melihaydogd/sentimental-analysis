Throw Back To The 1950's? 40"s?
Wow, this won Best Picture, whoops The Accountant's messed up the envelopes, and they did it without help. Not best picture, and it was filmed at Warner Brothers studios in California. The movie does have very good music (special thanks to John Legend). Jazz is great stuff and the music of strong emotions. That is what this movie plays to, the music.

Emma Stone (who was in the Best Picture Birdman last year) is Mia, a struggling actress unlike Stone, whose trying to make it so hard, she writes a 1 Woman play, and pays a theater so she can perform it one night. Meanwhile, Ryan Gosling is Sebastian, struggling jazz pianist who meets Mia and teaches her to love jazz. In the meantime, they love for a year, as the movie starts in spring, then the rest of the seasons, until Winter when Mia puts on her play, and then gets called to an audition because of the play, and gets a big star making role in Paris.

Sebastian wants to open a jazz piano bar. He needs money and is still looking for money to open the bar when Mia leaves. Then the film moves ahead to 5 years later when Mia is a star and comes back to California where her husband takes her to Sebastian's Jazz Bar. Then we get the road not taken routine (Mia has a daughter with her husband when she gets back), a dream sequence, and then Mia and her husband leave Sebastian at his piano in the bar.

The movie is in Panorama, the sets are expensive, and the acting is good, the dancing so-so, and the music great. I see people rating this a 10, yet with the exception of cell phones being used in the film, it pretty much could have been filmed 50 to 70 years ago.

Yes, it is well done, but like Alfred Hitchcock's TOPAZ, while the material is good, it is dated material. I like TOPAZ better, but it could have been made in the 1950's instead of the 1960's. This film even has an antique convertible car from the 1960's in the beginning of the film that confused me about what time period this film was in, briefly.

To me, unless you really like the music, which I do, this film is an old fashioned romance that could put you into La La Land. It is easier to follow than Birdman, but then the romance dream in my life always takes place on a flying carpet. It is one heck of a dream to find the perfect mate, and it only happens in the movies.

Real life is as big a let down, as the best picture dream being shattered by a letter that was supposed to be put in the shredder, not on the stage. Sweet Dreams, La La Land puts me to sleep.
