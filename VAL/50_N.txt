Shaky Cam and Rehashed Action Ruins It
Moviegoers above the age of 13 will recognize most of the action set pieces and plot elements from other films. There's an elevator fight, which we've seen before. Evil cops, evil suits, "big brother" danger, some running from fire and more explosions.

The fundamental problem with these movies is that you never feel like the main characters are in any danger. No matter how much of a beating Captain America takes, he's going to live to make sequels. The same goes for all of the popular cast members. Given the immortality of the good guys, the only question is How they're going to get out of peril. Don't expect anything new here.

The best writing is happening on television, sadly. Film-quality writing is going to HBO and independent networks, and television directors are moving to the big screen.

This one is all washed up. Hail hydra.
