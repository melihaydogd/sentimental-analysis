Tedious and Pretentious
Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) is a currency dealer who makes whopping profits by trading on infinitesimal variations in exchange rates. He is being ferried through the streets of New York to get a haircut by his favourite barber. A large chunk of the film's action takes place in a futuristic limousine outfitted like a space module including a draw-out toilet. People hop in and out of his car to have long cerebral conversations with him. The conversations get quite irritating because the barrage of words keep coming at you relentlessly without any visual relief. There is one particularly vacuous conversation with his wife about sex. The limousine practically crawls because there is an anarchic protest on the streets, but Packer is oblivious of the mob in his sound proof car. The traffic is also held up by the funeral procession of a pop star. The ride in the limousine is a metaphor of Packer's journey into perdition.

The film has no plot. You keep looking for a satisfying denouement that never happens. Pattinson plays Packer with a blank expression and actually does a good job of making us loathe him. Other characters are eminently forgettable.

Cronenberg has crafted an atmosphere of icy coldness in the film. But Cosmopolis is so cold and clinical that it is difficult to connect with its soul. You are glad when this tediously pretentious film ends.
