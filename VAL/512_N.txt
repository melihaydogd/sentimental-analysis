An unfunny "comedy" for very simple-minded people
Black guy takes care of white guy. Black guy is poor and white guy is rich. They teach each other how to live better. Isn't it touching? Oh my God, I'm weeping right now, while I write these lines... NOT! This film is pathetic and the only way to explain the high ratings and its success is through the fact that most people are easily touched by stories that are sentimental and about friendship and moral values. Similar to why Paulo Coelho's books are bestsellers, for example.

To compare: Little Britain's Lou and Andy are funny exactly because they are not trying to teach you a moral lesson or show you how important it is to have a friend or help someone.

Simple story. Clich√©. Sentimental. Boring.
