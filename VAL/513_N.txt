Underdeveloped monster flick
People raved about this movie so much that we were actually really excited to see it (and I love Key & Peele, so I figured it would be creative and well executed.) But to our disappointment, this movie was awful. Overall, it was just really basic and tried to twist old horror themes into something different under the guise of something unique, while being way over-directed, forcing social themes which were largely inorganic to the plot, and presenting several holes in the overall logic of the story that made it hard to "buy in" at any point in the movie. I'd really hoped this would be a chilling thriller that would keep me on the edge of my seat, but we were barely able to finish it.
