Overrated
The only thing good about this movie was the beautiful scenery. The acting was decent but I'll probably only be able to view Rachel McAdams as a popular and mean high school girl. The story was predictable and boring. I thought Allie was a superficial slut and didn't have any chemistry with Noah. Their relationship was based on looks and sexual desire. I didn't see them have a true conversation once in the movie. Not only that, but when Allie was engaged she actually went and had sex with Noah. That, to me, would seem like it would make her fianc√© angry, but he didn't even care. The ending was disappointing, especially in comparison to the novel's, even though I didn't enjoy the novel either. It's one of the most overrated romances I have ever seen. I think I probably expected a masterpiece, and what I got was complete boredom. I would think twice before watching this movie.
