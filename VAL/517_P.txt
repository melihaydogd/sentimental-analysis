Great!
Halle Barry did an excellent portrayal of cat woman. In fact, she brought new dimensions to this fictional character in regards to being a dynamic, round, intelligent, caring, loving, extremely attractive, athletic, growing woman.

The other characters in the movie were perfect for their respective roles, especially cat woman's beatable nemesis.

There was some speckles of humor by one of the characters that was worth wile. It was actually funny. I really enjoyed all the elements (characters & props) that forged this film. They (all involved) did a pretty good job on this movie despite what renown critics say.

I would recommend this DVD to be introduced to anyone's collection.

Oh, another great thing...there was no sex scenes as most movies tend to deem a necessity for sales. This is also encouraging to those woman (and men) who struggle with accepting who they are. There are messages here (in the movie). There are even some faith connotations as well. See if you can catch it.
