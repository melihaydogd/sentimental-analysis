Really good but somewhat flawed
"Coco" its the latest Disney Pixar animated film, I try not to miss that many Pixar movies and even if a few of them have escaped me I still do whatever I can do to watch them, I love a good Disney movie and "Coco" its no exception.

I know that the gimmick this time its that it takes elements from the Mexican tradition known as El dia de los muertos (actually, it takes elements from general Mexican culture) but I cant help to feel that this is a small story that happens to take place in a huge startling world, we follow our characters through a journey that only affects them, the rest of the world does not depend on their fate but they aren't apathetic towards them, its a nice balance between a big story and a personal one.

The plot isn't anything special, the world it establishes isn't special either, the characters are likable but they aren't great, except for a few of them like our main lead who carries the whole movie (as it should be), yet I wish they would have developed the rest of the family a little more or at least in a better way.

The movie opens with exposition, as many modern Pixar movies do, I remember "Moana" doing this too, it doesn't bother me that much, I know that there's a lot to explain and to establish, so I just go along with it until it stops giving us information and tries to have actual scenes, when we get to them they are worth it. While I do like movie I will say it hits all the story beats a movie like this would, its not original, its quite predictable and melodramatic at points, but its effective, for whatever flaws it may have, never do they break the mood and they feel somewhat insignificant when compared to the wonders the film offers. The themes and subjects it plays with are familiar to me, physical death isn't the worst thing awaiting man and the pursuit of a dream will take away part of you.

I was predicting where it would go and I was also awaiting for an specific moment to come, as I knew that it will be executed perfectly, and it was. I had a good time watching this, when its not being good its about as average as you can get, that goes to show how superior Pixar is to the rest, when they are not being exceptional they on the same level as their competition.
