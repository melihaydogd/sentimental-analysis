A gloriously ghastly schlockfest
Inept Russian spy Mischa Lowzoff (a hopelessly dorky portrayal by Michael Terr) sneaks into America with a cute white rabbit that's infected with a lethal virus with the specific intent of destroying our country. It's up to rock singer and secret agent Britt Hunter (an earnest and likable performance by Arch Hall Jr.) to save the day. Man, does this absolutely horrendous honey possess all the right wrong stuff to qualify as a real four star stinkeroonie: The ham-fisted (mis)direction by James Landis (who previous did the superior suspense thriller "The Sadist"), an alarming wealth of demeaning ethnic stereotypes, the meandering narrative, the pitifully unfunny sense of blithely inane humor, a slew of lame slapstick gags, the exaggerated goofy sound effects, a cuddly bunny that talks in an annoying squeaky voice (!), a supremely idiotic over-cranked climactic slapstick chase set piece, the sprightly cornball film library score, and a positively ungodly consumption of vodka all ensure that this deliciously dreadful dud is entertaining in the best worst way possible. The enthusiastic cast have a field day with the asinine material: The ravishing Liz Renay delightfully vamps it up as sultry femme fatale Cecelia Soloman, Hal Bizzy rolls his eyes for all it's worth as evil Nazi Heinrich Krueger, Arch Hall Sr. offers a thick'n'juicy slice of undiluted ham as Mischa's overbearing superior Marshall Malout, and the diminutive Jack Little bumbles and fumbles with utmost aplomb as blundering squirt Maxwell Stoppie. The adorable Sharon Acker makes a favorable impression as spunky cowgirl Jackie Gavin while Richard Kiel has a sizable uncredited role as a hulking ranch foreman. Vilmos Zsigmond's vibrant color cinematography provides a satisfying bright look. A choice chunk of kitschy crud.
