Not bad but leaves out
The film maker really wanted to make a film decrying poor treatment of homosexuals but had to get the good stuff in about the incredible contribution Turing made to the war effort and his brilliant, kooky, iconoclastic mind. But he began with the 1951 investigation into his homosexuality and then drifted back into the war, came back again to the investigation, finally went back to the great war intrigue story of him breaking the Enigma code against all odds, but kept going forward to the darn police investigating his sexuality as if it mattered to the breaking of the code...which it didn't. Finally, before the true code story was finished -- namely how he helped them ingeniously use the information from the code breaking to help the war effort without tipping off the Nazi's that they'd broken the code is simply stated as an afterthought. He had a huge part in that and it was dropped so we had to go back to the police investigation that eventually led to his needless torment and his sad suicide (which also was referenced). Could have been a great movie. Wasn't. Too bad the film makers agenda got in the way of his story telling.
