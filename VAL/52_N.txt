Hammer's later movies ran out of gas
Hammer did some very good monster films in the 1950's and 60's, but by the 1970's, they were running out of gas and rehashing some tired old idea.

The plot is that Jack the Ripper's daughter watched her father brutally murder her mother, and is set into murderous rampages whenever she sees shiny things and is kissed on the cheek.

I kid you not, this is the plot. She is taken in by a Kindly Doctor with no sense, and she proceeds to murder a few people.

Again, all the style of a Hammer film, no real substance to speak of. It's "Hammer Lite". "Taste Grate, Less Killing".
