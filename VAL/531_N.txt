Not very funny, or exciting, or interesting
I was excited to see this film given the hype over how funny it was, irreverent to super hero movies, and interestingly adult (love story) it was. It was none of these. The characters were annoying, the plot was not suspenseful, and the dialog was mostly child like potty and sex humor. The only love story was between a lustful superhero and a stripper. They only reason they loved each other was because no one else would or could since they are despicable. Some of the scenes were so disrespecting to human life I had to close my eyes and turn my head to stop from getting sick. I noticed that some people left the movie. Perhaps this movie was not made for people like me. What I found most disappointing and confusing was how disconnected the story was. The super hero and the villains were so powerful at some times and then at other times they were killed with one measly bullet or punch. I will give it some credit for the graphics, sound effects, costumes, and animation. I kept wanting to like it but in the end I left unsatisfied.
