Makes Remake of "Planet of the Apes" Look Good
Obviously a much younger crowd writes these reviews. Absolutely no premium is put on direction, acting, or storyline. It's all about animation, action, and noise.

Everything that needs to be said about this film has already been said. It is a remarkable exercise in film technology, but oh, so long, and oh, so tedious. After Jurassic Park One, I never thought I would weary of too many dinosaurs, but here I actually found myself anxiously anticipating the return to New York.

I liked Naomi Watts at first, but then Peter Jackson stops directing her, and she becomes totally predictable. Everyone else seems to be freelancing.

And what of the natives? What are they? White people in black face? Who are they? Refugees from King Solomon's Mines? Relatives of that guy who has filed his teeth and turned himself into a lizard (refer to the Discovery Channel)? Very strange . . .

Kong also looks as if he is about 175 years old. No wonder he only looks at Naomi. That's all he can do.
