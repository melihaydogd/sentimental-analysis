Powerful and overwhelming images and faces
The life of capeverdian immigrants in Lisbon, Portugal. The plot story is not conspicuously remarkable and we only become aware of it through the characters' conversations. It is about their real problems. The characters are not proffessional actors and just immigrants themselves but they do a very good job. A rather interesting movie, well acted and directed.
