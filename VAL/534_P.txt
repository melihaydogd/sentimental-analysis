I had a boss who was a dead ringer for Norma Desmond.
(Spoilers...)She was as old as the hills, you could see her time has come and gone but you couldn't tell her that. She married a man who was 40 years younger than she was. She was rich. She took 'care' of him. She also lived in a house with her ex. And back in the day, she was very pretty. And one day, she snapped.I'm talking about my ex-boss. Really.Now about the movie. I saw this on the wonderful Los Angeles based "Z" channel in the 1980's. This film was too much!!! It was fantastic. The music, the theme, the actors: Gloria Swanson and William Holden. It told a story and the story kept me going. Everybody kicked butt in this film...everybody -- (including a young "Joe Friday"!)This is what DRAMA is in a film. This is what a DIVA QUEEN is in film. This is a look inside Hollywood no one wants to admit.RUN!!! Don't walk and get this film. Buy it, don't rent it, because you'll want to own it and watch it again and again.Drama!!! A Masterpiece!!
