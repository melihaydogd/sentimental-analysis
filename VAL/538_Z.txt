why all the negative reviews?
My wife and I enjoyed it. I was entertained and that is all that matters. If there was bad acting I did not see it. Yes there are a thousand movies with the same story line. But all movies are the same, different time, different places, different actors. Also seems to me that a lot of reviewers have very negative attitudes to everything. I find within ten minutes of watching a film I can tell if is going to entertain me, and I turn it off if it does not. Why sit through a movie if you do not like it and then criticise it. Strange.
