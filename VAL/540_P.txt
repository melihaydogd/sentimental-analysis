Very good, but not excellent
This was a movie that I had never seen completely until recently. I had really high expectations for Chinatown. From what I had heard and read about this film was that it was as good or better than other 1970s movies such as "The Godfather", "The Conversation", "The Sting", or "Taxi Driver". I thought this was a very good movie, but not an excellent movie and definitely not as good as the Francis Ford Coppola movies of this time.

Chinatown seemed a bit slow and long to me. I did like Jack Nicolson's performance however, but his acting along with the good directing wasn't enough for me to call it an excellent movie. The performances of the other actors was good, but I didn't think it was great.

I'll watch this movie again in a few months, maybe then I'll feel more highly about it.

I rate this movie a generous 7 out of 10. I was thinking of rating it a 6.
