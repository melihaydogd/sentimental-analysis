Great movie, maybe too intense for small kids
This is a great film. Pixar has done it again, in a silly, serious, very fun way. The animation is top-notch. I agree with other posters that the scenery is extremely well done. The colors are magnificent, especially the sunsets in Paris. Makes you want to move there right now. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and even a couple that brought a tear to my eye. However, I&#39;m glad I pre-screened it before I brought my four-year-old. There are some scenes that are too intense for her to handle on the big screen. I will definitely purchase the DVD, but will not be bringing her to the theatre. Oh, and that cartoon before the movie was gut-busting. What fun!
