No...just no. Completely unbelievable & just bad.
I decided I'd go ahead and stream the first two episodes...we're snowed in right now so I have plenty of time. I'm sorry I wasted the time. It's just not even worth watching! The fighting is unbelievable and is obviously fake..it's like a bad movie. Queen Latifah is an awesome actor but this role is too contrived for her, she doesn't come across as a former "secret squirrel" type and just not convincing. It's just a bit of a downer because she always does a good job. I was certainly expecting this "reimagining" of the series to have some of the same "feel" as the original, but it's just too forced. It just tries too hard to make everything fit and like I said, it all feels too contrived. I don't see it getting the ratings it'll require to be renewed.
