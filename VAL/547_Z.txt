Watchable thanks to Cruise and Diaz.
It's been a while since a movie has so heavily relied on the charismatic pairing of its lead couple to rake in the crowds. Chances are you won't see this because the action in the trailer hooked you in, but rather because you're interested to see if these two waning Hollywood heavyweights can still produce the magic they clearly had in their heyday. Well, I've got some good news and some bad news.

The good news is that this potentially dynamic duo actually have a splendid chemistry. Their effortless banter is natural and humorous, as if they've been sharing the screen together for years. Cruise is especially electric as he confidently offers a tongue-in-cheek performance that isn't afraid to mock his larger-than-thou action star persona. Where I expected him to turn one way, he unflinchingly opts for path number two and takes his unhinged spy to a place I didn't previously consider. Diaz isn't quite as thrilling in her role – June is a much more stock-standard routine – however she provides the ideal counterpart for The Cruiser and indeed bounces off him with ease. She looks a whole lot better in swimwear too.

Now for the bad news: everything surrounding Cruise and Diaz is dreadful. And I mean everything. For starters, the plot has more holes in it than Sonny's car in The Godfather. Not just small gaps that are accepted as necessary to facilitate the addition of a really cool scene, but rather large and mindless cracks that are formed because of lazy screen writing. Then there is the strangely uninspired and bland turn by the otherwise terrific Sarsgaard. The An Education actor doesn't appear to want to be there, mumbling and fumbling his dialogue with a woodenness I wouldn't have thought in his repertoire.

Worst of all though is the surprisingly shonky special effects that accompany the already average action. With an estimated budget of over $100m, is it too much to hope for realistic computer and practical effects? It's not even a CGI-dominated film where the flaws can be spotted without difficulty, it's basic age-old techniques like background matting that fail miserably here. Every time we're watching people in a vehicle – which is a lot – it's plain as day that they're on a sound stage somewhere in L.A. sitting in front of a green screen. I can't even start to explain how dire the effects were for the bull-running set piece which featured our protagonists on a motor bike.

Watchable thanks to Cruise and Diaz, but they deserved a much better platform to prove they still have what it takes in Tinseltown.
