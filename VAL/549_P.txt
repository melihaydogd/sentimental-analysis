A great little film from the 80's.
An enjoyable little film that might not be as well know as it should. One of the reasons I saw this film was because some of the cast(including Pamela Springsteen) where in this film and that sparked my interest. At first everyone told me this film was not going to be very good, good thing I didnt listen to them, because this film is one of the better teen comedies from the late 80's.Before I start with the review, I'm going to summarise the plot for those that havent seen it.Auggie and his pal Drew graduated from college and now have to find a job. Drew's cousin Sam owns a run down gas station that is the target of Wrangler Bob for one of his new fast food joints. Instead of selling, Auggie takes out a loan so they can turn the gas station into a fast food joint of their own. Auggie spikes the secret sauce with a powerful aphrodisiac, after that hilarity ensues. Thats all I'm saying, for the rest you must see the film for yourself.Now for my review(unlike the summary this does contain Spoilers, you have been warned).Don't listen to critics, this is a really funny film, eact actor in the film gives a great performance. The direction from Micheal A. Simpson is great and I thinkg Simpson could have been a big director, but the things that he's done aint that bad either. The film does get a bit bogged down in end with the courtroom scene and never quite picks up after that, but since the films about over anyway, its a minor flaw. My favourite part of the film is when they catar a sorority party and unleash the burgers on the crowd(the party consists of stuck of rich kids, and my favourite actress: Pamela Springsteen. Not much of a review, but thats my thoughts on the fillm, it is a bit hard to find(I had to purchase it online), but if you can find it, I definitely recommend seeing it.
