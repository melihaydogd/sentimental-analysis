The reconstruction is excellent. The visual effects create very accurate images. But it's like "Titanic" in WWII. A lot of movies has been made on that subject and there are lots of true stories that deserve to be told without such sugarcoated style. Maybe if Spielberg had made a remake of "The longest day" with the production used for this movie, he would have made a great movie. He wouldn't have to resort to  the predictable last scene when Pvt Ryan salutes John Miller's grave.
