A Different Opinion

I came into this movie hoping I'd like it. I heard from other reviewers saying it was great, but others disliked it. I however, am part of the latter.

I'm going to try my best to write this review without any spoilers, even though there's one moment that made my sister walk out of the theater in anger and made me nearly scream.

This review is coming from someone who has watched 2 Superman movies, 8 and a half seasons of Smallville, and a season of Lois and Clark. I think I have knowledge of the original source material.

First off, I'll discuss what made up most of the movie, the fight scenes. The only indicator to tell what the hell was going on is that Superman is wearing blue and the villains are wearing grey. It was also shaky and the city looks absolutely ugly with the grey and brown colors everywhere. Also, Superman sometimes doesn't seem to care about people within the city dying as a result of the fights.

Now the acting. Amy Adams was a very bland Lois. Her connection with Canvill's character seemed like a friendship. Costner and Crowe aren't actors I'm a fan of, so obviously, I didn't like them. Everyone else's acting was either bland or average. Also for original fans, Perry White is bland too as a character and Lana Lang shows up for two scenes.

There were a couple of moments that would be spoilers if I gave away why I hated them, but I'll just summarize in this: Bland acting, awful fight scenes, gross looking scenery, missing the point within characters, and boring as hell.

I'm only giving it 2 stars because at first the scenery wasn't the worst I've ever seen, some of the acting was good, Martha Kent was very good, and the fight scenes weren't so repetitive at first.
