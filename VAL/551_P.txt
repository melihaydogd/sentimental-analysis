Not perfect, but well-acted and very uplifting
Like the title says, this movie isn't perfect because there's a lot of "stuff" going on that can't all be tackled in 90 minutes. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that the film needed to be longer.Viewer may be left asking for some more backstory on a couple of things, and one of the most critical plot-lines of the movie isn't really referenced or confronted very much outside of flashbacks. I understand that may have been intentional, however I don't think it was successful.With that said, the positive outweighs the negatives big time with this film. It really is a genuine love story with great chemistry between Michael Grant, who plays James; and Josh Green, who plays Charlie. There are moments in the film that captivate you a bit, because of how genuinely you can tell that one cares for the other despite rough times.The personal struggles of the father are also well-acted, with a number of subtleties that come through really well for a middle-aged, depressed man dealing with the crumbling of everything he knows.This movie is one of those gay coming-of-age films that really will warm your heart because of the acting. Definitely worth your time.
