Oh dear

The only reason I watched this film was to see that beautiful Josh Whitehouse again. I very much enjoyed his performance as Hugh Armitage in the Poldark series on PBS. However this film was formulaic, the set decoration was over the top excessive and the two costars had zero chemistry. Too bad because the idea was a cute concept; the execution, however, was extremely flawed.
