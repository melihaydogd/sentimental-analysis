Heartfelt true story that's set on the eve of WWII
So few movies today capture the emotion and artistry of storytelling better than 'The Dig'. It's based on a true story that was beautifully made. It combines amazing performances by a magnificent ensemble along with majestic cinematography. I absolutely loved this movie and enjoyed every moment. If ever there was a Netflix movie that deserved Oscar consideration this one would be it for me. You will not be disappointed.
