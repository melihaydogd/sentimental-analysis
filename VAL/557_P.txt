A masterpiece!!!!
This movie is an absolute pleasure to watch!!! It is one of the most visually gorgeous movies I've ever seen and the cinematography is second to none. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both give excellent, layered and hilarious performances as Mia and Sebastian. Throughout the film, you really get to know the characters and by the end, you really care about them. This film is intended as a love letter to the golden days of cinema and I think it does this with brilliance and effortless charm. The soundtrack is phenomenal, all of the musical/dance numbers are visualy breathtaking and the choreography is awesome. This movie has some heart wrenching emotional scenes while pulling off the comedic vibe with ease. There's not much this film doesn't do. It's pretty hard to fault, to be honest. This film is definitely worthy of it's Oscar wins and truly is, a masterpiece!!!
