Vastly Overrated
This film had amazing CGI, that's undeniable. It was also full of bad Hollywood clich√©d dialogue (a prime example being all of the dialogue between Jimmy and Mr Hayes), plot elements (the predictable romance subplot) and fake overdone attempts at sentimentality, combined with some frankly disturbing racial imagery in its depiction of the native 'savages' (obviously counteracted with the token black character), the kind of stereotyping presumably used as a recreation of similar elements in 30s movies but which died out for a reason. The attempts at clever styles of shooting often came across as almost self-parodying in their laughability, such as when one of the characters taps out a word into a typewriter in slow motion while the camera cuts to the shocked expression of another, while the film was absurdly over-long for the amount of story available, done by stretching out sections of action far beyond the point that they became boring, many of which were in any case totally unnecessary for plot development and seemed more about showcasing the great CGI. In short it was a gratuitous and wasteful movie, bloated with its own budget and ultimately pointless.
