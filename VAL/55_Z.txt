Butterfly Effect of Love
In Cornwall, the clumsy Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) lives a pleasant life with his family but he is awkward with the girls and unlucky in love. At the age of twenty one, his father (Bill Nighy) discloses a family secret to him, telling that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time. The skeptic Tim finds that his father is telling the truth and when he moves to London to work as a lawyer, he falls in love with the insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams) and seduces her fixing his mistakes in the relationship. Along his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.

"About Time" is an overrated movie about a clumsy guy that discovers that he has the ability of traveling in time and uses his skill to fix mistakes in life. The plot is a sort of "Butterfly Effect" of love, but is repetitive and tiresome. The lovely Margot Robbie and the smile of Rachel McAdams save this movie from a fiasco since Domhnall Gleeson is too dull for a lead role. My vote is six.
