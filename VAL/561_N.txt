Awful. Don't waste your time.
Such an enormous waste of time and money that could be given to Scorsese or Tarantino to make another movie. The plot was confusing and unimaginative, the acting was not bad but not great either. Tom Cruise has never appealed to me other than his Mission Impossible movies and Edge of Tomorrow sealed the deal for me. Something was off from the beginning. From the first five minutes I knew that something wasn't right with this movie. The writing was unrealistic and laughable and the camera work reminded me of some homemade go pro videos. This could've been a great movie if it were presented 10x better, and it pains me to know that the director will probably never redeem himself after a blunder as big as this one. The special effects and CGI weren't even that great, and they needed to be for a movie about aliens.
