You'd think a movie called Zombies Vs. Strippers would be at LEAST entertaining.
So this is what our species have come to. To be honest, it's not terrible, but it's just boring. The main cast and zombies aren't interesting at all, the locations are dark and forgettable, and the plot essentially goes nowhere. Again, it's not the worst, it's just bland and forgettable, and that's saying something for a Full Moon picture. The good parts? Well, there's a guy with a pig nose and a few decent jokes. So I guess if you want to watch this movie, be my guest.
