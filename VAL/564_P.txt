much better than everyone says it is.
I have no gripe about this movie. The plot is an adaptation of what The Great Gatsby, which I love.

Anyone who says that the beginning gives away the end, probably has attention deficiency disorder and didn't pay attention to the actual story. There were many instances in which you suspect the movie would end with the opening scene, but it just didn't.

And I don't agree with anyone saying that the characters are "stereotyped." There are many types of blacks portrayed in this movie, from the "straight from the ghetto and 'real' about it" to the reserved, cool "gangsters" to the type that wants to conform to "higher" society. The rowdiness and uncouthness of the people in Summer G's party are necessary in keeping the feeling of the book The Great Gatsby, where the newly-rich in Gatsby's party are unaware of the etiquette of blue-blood society.

And to those who said "there is no hip hop," I believe that I did hear some rap/hiphop played several times throughout the movie. You don't expect to have an entire music video film, do you? Overall, I thought this movie was great. There was some arguably unnecessary material sprinkled throughout the film, but it should definitely get higher than a 4.4.
