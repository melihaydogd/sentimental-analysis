Old and not too smart
It doesn't ask any questions, the guy should be killed because he murders children, though I realize this was made with a Religious influence. Anyway, old movie, not very good, the acting is cheesy, laughable. It's not a bad movie, just not worth anything. I completely see how it's influential though. It's well-made.
