Two Jews On Film Go In Different Directions With This SciFi Epic
'I Am Number Four' directed by D. J. Caruso (Disturbia) is a scifi/action/teen-love story based on the best selling novel of the same name.

Alex Pettyfer portrays John Smith (Number Four). John is your basic teenage alien from the planet, Lorien. He's being hunted by the super evil Mogadorians. The villanious Mogadorians are eliminating the nine Loriens that are hiding on earth in numerical order.

When the film opens, Lorien Number Three, who's been living in Florida, has just been killed. Realizing that he's next, John and his teacher/protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant) exchange their identities for new ones, flee Florida and settle in the small town of Paradise Ohio.

So what's an 'alien on the run' to do?...Enter high school of course. This doesn't sit too well with Henri. Henri wants John to keep a low profile while he's waiting for his powers to develop to their full potential. John promises Henri that he'll stay off the radar.

Well, that's hard to do when your hands glow like lightbulbs and you can toss around football players and police cars as if they were made of feathers. It also doesn't help. when you fall for a hot chick named Sarah (Dianna Agron) who the star quarterback(Jake Abel) thinks is his property. Things in Paradise get messy very quickly and that's where the fun begins.

'I Am Number Four' has romance, action, super bad aliens that look like bikers with piranha teeth and basically everything a teenager could want in a sci/fi movie. Of course, I am not a teenager and I absolutely loved this film. Gave it four bagels out of five.
