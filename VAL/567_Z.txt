Socioeconomics is stupid
I own this movie on DVD, yeah or the reverse is true and the movie owns me, some philosophical stuff to be worked out later. This movie is about naked people's bodies, but they wear clothes and dance- not regular dancing though. Sexy dancing! I'm pretty sure that's the movie's title, Sexy Dancing, I don't know I should check to make sure. The point is, this is where babies come from, a man sexy dances with a lady and then afterwards they have sex and that is why humans are here. I feel like you're asking me a question and I'm totally blanking right now I'm super sorry about that.
