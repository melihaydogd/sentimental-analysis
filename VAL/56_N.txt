the AI is more human than the main character and the villain.
I mean let's think about it. the nerdy main character basically falls in love with the moving plastic figure(yes.. the AI robot mostly had 'transparent steel wire thingy for her body') after talking to her a few times... which is just... sad and very unrealistic(maybe a 50 year old virgin would be like that .. not really). And the villain is supposedly a super genius and yet he doesn't even have shotguns or pistols hidden in random places so that he can be safe against robots with 'knives'.... and he gets stabbed with a knife by a robot while he showing his back to an aggrevated/escaping robot with A KNIFE even though he knew the robot was trying to escape. He knew the robot had a knife in its hand and it was escaping and YET he just turned around to talk to the other robot... yeah, the 'humans' in the movie were acting soooo dumb to be considered human.
