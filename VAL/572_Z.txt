The History of a most beautiful, most vertuous, most learned, and every way accomplish'd Lady
Agora" is a recent film set in classical times which is neither a large-scale "sword and sandal" epic like "Gladiator" or "Troy", nor an action movie like "The Eagle" or "Centurion". Rather, it is a biopic of Hypatia of Alexandria, a female philosopher, mathematician and astronomer who lived in Egypt in the late 4th and early 5th centuries AD. She was a real person, although the facts of her life are disputed, particular controversy surrounding the exact circumstances of and motivation for her murder at the hands of a mob in 415 AD.

The film is set against the background of the struggle for pre-eminence between the old religion of Greco-Roman polytheism and the rising new faith of Christianity. Alexandria also had a large Jewish community, who play a part in the story. In the heyday of the Roman epic, the 1950s, films on this theme ("The Robe", "Quo Vadis?", "Ben Hur") almost always had a pro-Christian slant, but this is quite absent from "Agora", in which the Christians of Alexandria are generally portrayed as being ignorant, fanatical and cruel bigots, determined to stamp out any rival systems of thought. Not that the religiously observant polytheists are really any better. Near the beginning of the film one elderly pagan is heard to regret the fact that it is no longer permitted to feed Christians to the lions, as would have been done in his grandfather's time, and the pagans are as keen to instigate pogroms against the Christians as vice-versa.

In reality Hypatia was a philosopher of the Neo-Platonist school, a group who had many things in common with Christianity; they believed, for example, in a single God and in the immortality of the soul, and their teachings were a strong influence on early Christian theology. The film, however, is not particularly interested in Hypatia's religious or philosophical beliefs; she is portrayed by Rachel Weisz as a rationalistic sceptic, unconvinced by either Christianity or polytheism. It is much more interested in her supposed mathematical and astronomical thinking. None of her writings on these subjects have survived, but in the film she is portrayed as not an advocate of a heliocentric model of the solar system, to which the Christians object on religious grounds. Moreover, she is also shown as anticipating (by more than a thousand years) Kepler's discovery that the planets move around the sun in elliptical rather than circular orbits.

In the early eighteenth century the deist philosopher John Toland wrote a tract with the rather long-winded title "Hypatia: Or the History of a most beautiful, most vertuous, most learned, and every way accomplish'd Lady; who was torn to pieces by the Clergy of Alexandria, to gratify the pride, emulation, and cruelty of their Archbishop, commonly, but undeservedly, stil'd St. Cyril". I am not sure if the film-maker Alejandro Amenábar used Toland's work as one of his sources, but that title could also serve as a summary of the film's ideological position. Hypatia is the heroine; beautiful, intelligent, rational and an ardent defender of science and reason. The main villain is Cyril, the fanatical, rabble-rousing Patriarch of Alexandria, a man who hates Hypatia partly because of her refusal to embrace Christianity, partly because of her advocacy of theories regarded by the Church as heretical and partly because she makes a convenient target in his continuing feud with Orestes, the Roman Governor of Alexandria. (Cyril suspects Orestes, with some justification, of having made an insincere conversion to Christianity for purely political reasons).

The film attempts to be a "film of ideas", tackling a big subject, the relationship between religion and science. Unfortunately, it does so in a historically inappropriate way. The idea of a fundamental "conflict between religion and science" is a nineteenth-century one, largely superseded by modern histories of science. Those who propounded the idea of such a conflict tended to concentrate on a few selected episodes, such as the persecution of Galileo by the Inquisition and the controversy over Darwinism, and there is no evidence of such a conflict in fifth-century Egypt and no historical support for the idea of Hypatia as a proto-Galileo eleven centuries avant la lettre, which is how Amenábar invites us to see her. As I said, the exact reason for her murder is disputed, but it appears to have had more to do with anti-pagan bigotry and with local Alexandrian politics than with any opposition to her scientific work.

The film's other main flaw is that with a multitude of major characters- there are many others besides the few referred to above- and a constant stream of plot developments which make the storyline difficult to follow. One scene that I found particularly strange was the one where Hypatia rejects the advances of a male admirer by presenting him with her menstrual rags in order to demonstrate the baseness of sexual desire. Now it is quite true that such a story is told about Hypatia in one early (although not contemporary) source, but Amenábar ignores the fact that to a modern audience such a gesture would be likely to indicate not philosophical detachment from carnal lusts but serious mental health issues. There are some better features about the film; Weisz's performance is not a bad one, and the attempt to recreate ancient Alexandrian life is quite impressive, but overall I was left with the impression that a much better film could have been made on this subject.
