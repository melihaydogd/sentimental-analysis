Only for sensitive souls
Very impressed about Angelina Joly's work. First war movie I see since long with deep sensitivity, very loyal to the feeling we had in Europe about this war. For those looking for typical Hollywood special effects, pass your way, you will not like it. This movie speaks to our hearts and souls. It shows the strength of a woman capable of love, even in the worst situation. It shows how unbearable war is even for men, how it destroys those who are doing it, and not only their 'victims'. The portrait painted by the main character at the end of the movie says it all: eyes circled with deep blue coulour expressing the depth of a loving person, not naive, not a 'victim' either, witnessing the atrocity of war between artificially separated brothers and sisters in the name of politics and religion. Even the differences between men and women are smoothed, not showed as usual. There is nothing 'standard' in this movie, that's probably why it doesn't satisfy those seeking for usual patterns. Well done Angelina, I was not expecting anything like that from you! A real good piece of Art
