Amazing!!!!
I'm not a great reviewer but I had post about this movie, it's very good, story is brilliant and acting is perfection by the main and supporting cast.

You think that the repeating of the same day would get tenuous after awhile, it surprisingly doesn't, each day is the same but different enough to still be entertaining and very well done!

The action scenes are very exciting and made my heart go and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!

Tom cruise just gets better and better with every movie, I know some are not huge fans of his but I think he's one of the best actors out there and one of the best action stars!

If you want great action, acting and a brilliant story line this film is for you.

One thing I will say is when I watch a movie the end is one of the most important thing for me, those last 30 seconds of that movie leaves an impression on me and this ending *no spoilers* made me smile and I thought wow I need a sequel badly! Apparently there is one in the works right now with the same leading cast, I can not wait!

Enjoy the film guys if you decide to watch it!
