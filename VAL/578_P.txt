A Musical Masterpiece Showcasing The Beauty Of Jazz
From the opening sequence, this film captivates the audience through the dancing and singing bringing to life the essence of the film in a couple of minutes. A broadway musical on the screen makes you feel as if you are watching this performance live, it really connects to the audience as it's full of energy and passion. It reminds the viewers of the beauty that is jazz music and reality of an actor and musicians' dream of becoming successful and ultimately making a choice of what is more important to them.

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had a strong chemistry between them adding to the overall believability and connection to the characters. The film displays moments of comedy and changes to moments of seriousness rather smoothly. The audience feels for the characters' journey and individual growth as "Mia" played by Emma Stone and "Sebastian" played by Ryan Gosling pursue their passions for acting and music as they learn from each other who they are and what they want to become.

This film is my favourite musical movie as it cleverly uses jazz music in a modern and exciting way. The cinematography of the pool scene reminded me of the party in the film "The Great Gatsby" with all the loud music and dancing, adding to the atmosphere of the scene in both films. I recommend this movie for those who love musicals and enjoy playing a musical instrument or just listening to songs as well as those who love acting and performing. It's perfect for the whole family and a great way to feel inspired and motivated to pursue your dreams and express creativity.

This film will change the way you feel about jazz music and make you want to watch live concerts and shows. It has many lessons about the reality of wanting to become a musician or actor as it teaches you that it's all about learning to cope with rejection and to always look for opportunities and to never give up hope. One day your opportunity will come, you just have to push through the knock backs and be resilient. Problems may arise on the way as foreshadowed through the opening sequence song "Another Day of Sun" which talks about Mia and Sebastian's journeys' throughout the film but at the end, everything works out for the best no matter what they choose in the end. It doesn't always mean what's more important to them but what they need in that moment.
