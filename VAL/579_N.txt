Obviouslly the best XMen movie
Obviously the best XMen movie. Still bad. The giant leap forward is dumping the Stan Lee kind of intellect and the Halloween costumes. And some things can't be dumped. Like the solid metal claws that are trice the length of the hand from which they come. And with all the improvements, it is still a crap movie. So the new mutant has some power. A mutant has to have some powers, it's as much as Kirby's mind can go. But we don't know it. Than there are the bad guys. There has to be some bad guys, or else how else you get the fighting Messiahs? And the audience will see a slow scene with the bad guys coming in. Than there is a distraction. And a minor fight. Than the audience sees the mutant who does not hear anything. And the mutant is calm although there are screens showing what's going on outside. And the mutant does all these expressive faces waiting. And than the bad guys are in. And nothing. Switch to a big picture of the exterior of the building. And the music is off. And there is supposed to be some tension there.

Short version: see it in a form that allows you to fast forward. It's a 25 minute show at best.
