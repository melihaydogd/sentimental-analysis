Luckily not a sappy drama...
When I found "Happiness" (aka "Haeng-bok" or "HÃ¦ngbok") in the Asian movie section, I was instantly drawn to the movie because of the DVD cover. So I read the synopsis for the movie and it seemed interesting, so of course I decided to sit down to watch "Happiness".

I must admit that I had expected somewhat of a more sappy type of story given the premise of the storyline. But luckily director Jin-ho Hur didn't fall into the obvious choice and came up with a sappy story. No, instead the director went for a more personal and character-driven storyline which didn't cash in on cheap tear-jerking and playing on the illness of the two characters.

This was essentially more of a personal growth and love story than it was a sappy drama drawing cheap tears and emotional ups and downs from playing on the audience's sympathies for the two main characters.

The cast in the movie was quite good, and I do believe that this is the first time that I have gotten acquainted with Jung-min Hwang (playing Young-su) and Soo-jung Lim (playing Eun-hee). They had great on-screen chemistry, and they both performed very, very well both individually but also together on the screen.

As for the characters in the movie, then they were as well written and constructed as the storyline and script was. And it was characters that you instantly take a liking to, and it is characters that you can connect with and relate to. Though, I can't personally understand why Young-su would revert back to drinking and his former lifestyle after being so well on the path to recovery, but then again I never had an alcohol problem, so I can't fully grasp the severity of that addiction.

One of the most emotional scenes for me was seeing Eun-hee when she was running after she had her heart broken by Young-su's statement. And it was especially emotional because she had stated earlier in the movie that running might cause her to die.

The dialogue in the movie was quite well-written and it is clever dialogue that suits the story quite well, and it is dialogue that seems genuine and proper for the respective characters delivering them. There was definitely a lot of thought behind the script and dialogue, because it had quite an impact.

"Happiness" is a drama that hits hard, but luckily does so without being tacky and sappy. However, it is not a tearjerker as many others of the same premise would have been, and for that then I found "Happiness" to be quite good.
