safe from zombies on this island
my favorite kind of horror film is a zombie film. so i ordered ZOMBIE ISLAND MASSACRE from my local store, and when it arrived, my god i couldn't wait to watch it.when the film ended and i awoke, i was bitterly disappointed. "where were the zombies?" i mused. "why does this have an 18 certificate?" (equivalent to an R or even an NR in the USA)this film is a PG if ever i saw one. Labyrinth and Legend are scarier than this pile of rubbish.if you want a good zombie flick i recommend either Dawn of the Dead or Zombie Flesh Eaters. Lots of Zombies, lots of Violence & Blood --- nice.
