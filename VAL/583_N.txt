Mel Gibson not very convincing as Wallace
I was extremely surprised to find out that this was supposed to be such a good movie. I saw it on TV yesterday, and I hated it. It was soooo boring, and Mel Gibson was not at all convincing as William Wallace. He was looking like a 40 year old man that was still desperately trying to be young. He was supposed to be just a little bit older than the beautiful girl (whose name I forgot), but it was obvious he was much older.

The story was boring, and some parts of the movie were well acted, but I was so irritated by Gibson and the story line, that that did not make up much.
