A Waste Of Time and Talent
We stuck with this boring flick from beginning to end, searching for any reason why over 200,000 IMDb reviewers would on average rate this mess as nearly 8 out of 10 film.There is no reason.I watch about two hundred feature films every year and I am telling you reader -- there is nothing there. Period. Nothing.If you enjoy absurd levels of blood (again for no good reason) and you like lots of racial epithets, maybe you could sit through this film, but giving the the movie an eight rating? No way, no how.This film is a waste of talent and a waste of your time.
