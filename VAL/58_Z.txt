Interesting try
I wanted to write a lot about this movie but I read other reviews and I found out that they describe the film accurately so please read them. I really do not have anything to add to what other people wrote about it.

What I wanted to write about is the actress Zana Marijanovic. Since I know her personally I have to say she is such a nice and positive person. When she was without a boyfriend I tried to ask her for a date. She refused me flat out. Of course, I am not from the movie/acting business, but I am her fellow Sarajevan. Still, even that I was not to her liking I still, when I watch her act either in Gogo club or in Kamerni Teatar, like her very much. She radiates with such a positive energy, and is such a nice person. She is a Bosnian mixture of Sandra Bullock and Angelina Jolie.
