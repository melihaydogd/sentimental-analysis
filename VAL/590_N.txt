Extremely lame and long with no substance.
Well, where do I start?. Several points make this one of the most dreadful experiences I have had in cinema so far. In first place, the gore. I wish Snyder ever realizes that he just doesn't have to splatter the screen with blood every 35 seconds; not to mention body parts, open fractures, exploding bodies.... It is soooooooo useless and soooooooo becoming in a bad movie with no story whatsoever. In second place, the story. It could have been interesting, but it is presented in such a disorganized way, that it make you wonder what was on the mind of the writer and/or director. Three plot lines that, had they been developed, a great movie could have come out. In this case, they were just presented but not even barely developed. Third, the acting, with the possible exception of Rorshach. Maybe they are good performers, but the script was so idiotic that probably this was the best they could do. Fourth, the soundtrack. Very good songs completely inappropriate for the scenes they went with. What sick mind would put Sound of Silence in a cemetery scene, or the movement of Mozart's Requiem with the wrong tempo in the next to final scene. This is really incomprehensible to me. All in all, I give this movie two points. One for the special effects, the second one for the performance of the actor that played Rorschach. See it if you have to, or to form your own opinion.
