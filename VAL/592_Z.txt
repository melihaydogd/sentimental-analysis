Not one of Jim's best,
I have become a big Jim Carrey fan over the years. I think Me, Myself and Irene was the funniest of all. The Movie (not the TV version ). But this just left me feeling disappointed. Very few funny scenes. It was also very predictable. I could barely come up to a 4 in the rating system. It looked like a good chance for Jim to return to the level that he started, but the movie just falls flat. I guess you have to figure that there is no way you can say yes to everything and have things work out. It just seemed like an excellent opportunity for Jim to create something. I did like his love interest played by Zooey Deschanel, I could not place where I had seen her before, she has one of those familiar faces. Not too pretty, not to plain, just the kind of cute that I seem to go for. The closest thing I could compare this movie to would be Liar Liar.(only not as funny) But the same general idea. Maybe I like his humor to be more crude, but thats just me.
