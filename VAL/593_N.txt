What is the point of the last 7 episodes? spoiler
I am not an expert on the UK's criminal justice system, but it seems to me that they know who the killer is, where he lives, and they see him multiple times. What more preponderance of evidence do they need? Every detail points to him, including a fingerprint on the murder weapon. Why do they not arrest him? This show is like a Law and Order SVU episode, but not as good and 10 hours long.Why are there more episodes of this show? It does not make sense. Zero dramatic tension. Started off promising and ends as one of the most inane pieces of crap that I have ever watched. There is no reason at all for the last 5 episodes at least. I should never have started wasting my time on this show; I feel used. I have no clue why the reviews are largely positive; maybe they're for the first season. Do not be duped!
