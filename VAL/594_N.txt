Over rated
The movie had a potential to be good but it was a total disappointment, the acting was moderate, but they ware low on budget that they couldn't afford a boat for one of the scene so they made a CGI, the plot was super weak, and the story looks like a ripoff of Breaking Bad, they didn't bother explaining most of the stuffs are happening, in conclusion it was worse that Wonder Women
