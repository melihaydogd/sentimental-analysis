Masterpiece
There is not much to say about the movie. We've watched an acting lesson from the master, Anthony Hopkins for 90 minutes and I was just speechless at the end with the contribution of the soundtrack from another master Ludovico Einaudi.It was such a realistic drama reminding me my beloved grandfather that I've lost few years ago. It should definitely win the Oscar.
