too long and boring
After 15 mins it was easy to guess the story line, its been told so many times. Great cast that could have been in a much betterfilm. What a waste of their talent, or maybe they were just between jobs at the time. Another film where you could watch the first 5 mins, the middle 5mins and the end 2 mins to get the full picture.
