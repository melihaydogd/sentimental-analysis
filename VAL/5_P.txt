Cool, interactive, road trip softcore.
This review contains spoilers.Here's the plot. Brian has a fight with his girlfriend Monica (Renee Rea). Thinking she's through with him, he agrees to go to Malibu with his friend Zach. There's a sorority party there that's supposed to be a guaranteed weekend of eager, horny women. Monica finds out and convinces her friend Ashley (Tracy Ryan) to help her chase him down so she can tell him she still loves him.That alone probably would have been good enough to make this an above average softcore film, but the producers have also thrown in another little bit of fun. Throughout the film, there are several places where the characters are faced with a decision. The viewer gets to decide what they do. It's a good use of DVD technology and keeps things interesting.The story provides plenty of opportunity for numerous sex scenes and ample amounts of female skin. There's a sexy hitchhiker (Stephanie Schwartz), the mechanic's horny wife (Susan Featherly), and two hot female cops (Kira Reed and Nikki Fritz). There are nine sex scenes. Five are boy/girl, one is boy/girl/boy/girl, two are girl/girl, and one is girl solo. In addition, there is a nice shower scene with Renee and a wet t-shirt contest that Renee and Tracy participate in. All the women are super hot and give great performances. The music is a little too loud, but you can still hear the sounds of the actors during the sex scenes.
