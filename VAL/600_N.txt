Poor remake!

Whilst the landscape and population are interesting, the film lacks any real story as such. Max (Tom Hardy) has the charisma and depth of a mouldy pair of underpants. Charlize Theron has one arm for some reason which is never really justified, although it does add something to her character which would have been put to better use with Max.

The main villain, Immortan Joe is on of the better characters, albeit a rehashed version of Bane with Don Kings hair. He seemingly has two sons, one who is very small and disabled and the other who is a giant beast of a man. Yet again this is something the film makes no attempt to explain, which is a shame as it would add to the very thin plot.

The vehicle design is outstanding and credit must be given to the engineers who put them together, assuming they aren't all CGI.

To summarise the film they spend 50% of the runtime escaping the main villain and his henchmen only to turn back in the opposite direction to finish where they started.
