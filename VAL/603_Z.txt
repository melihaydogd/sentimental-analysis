Pompous, meaningless and boring, very boring, well, quite right, so much And how pathetic. If you like to watch movies where the ending is Known in advance, where there is no plot where the main character simply is, Where bombs are cleared in the last seconds, where popularity is achieved by the rebellious temper of teenagers, then this is for you.
