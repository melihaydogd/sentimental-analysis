Hello Dreamboat, Shall We Review The Accountant ?
Hello, Dreamboat. Shall we Chat about the film ?

Well we didn't backdoor the pentagon but just like the final song this film truly left something behind, a legacy.

This is how you make an action film, this is how you make a dramatic film, hell this is how you make a film, period. I cannot praise this film enough, it has everything you want; Superbly written layered characters that grow and evolve throughout the film, a strong, gripping, tense and highly entertaining storyline, highest quality acting and a thourougly satisfying ending.

Coming off 'The Town' I didn't think I'd see Ben play such a deep emotionally damaged but tough as nails character for a long time but this film truly brings out the best in Afflecks acting abilities.

Unlike the Muhammed Ali jigsaw puzzle this film takes its time to lay out all the pieces on the board, never missing a step in turning up the heat at just the right moments to keep you wanting more. It's like all the best moments from Taken, The Equalizer and John Wick rolled into one masterpiece of a film.

The hurt you feel for Christian Wolff and what he's had to endure makes you understand exactly why he lives the life he does. He's a survivor and a man seeking justice at all costs and damn does he deliver justice to the guilty.

What I loved was the characters never felt too over the top, they always felt real and true to who they were, which is difficult to do with people like Wolffs brother Brax and Anna Kendricks Dana but they were written perfectly and slotted into the story in just the right way to help Wolff grow and understand more about life outside his bubble.

He battled with his condition and succeeded and can solve even the most complex maths equations but you don't need to times 298,567 by 92 to realise this film is a masterpiece.10/10.
