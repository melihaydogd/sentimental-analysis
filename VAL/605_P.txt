Brilliant movie,
I rather enjoyed the movie for what it is. I don't get what the fuss is about, nor the '7.3' grade? Kong is depicted much less as a monster (while 'monster movie' genre has to be as filled with grotesque fantasy creatures as possible, at least some of those creatures don't necessarily have to be monstrous 'on the inside' as well) and with more sentiments, invoked within him when he meets a gentle female human. Sure, humans (Denham and his crew) were presented as cruel and immoral, but it is also thanks to a human (Ann Darrow) that Kong went through a transformation from a mere monster to a gentle, caring guardian of nature and a martyr of the crew's predator-like villainy as well as of bourgeois, anthropocentric sensation-hungry New York society.

I didn't give it 10 stars firstly due to its exaggerated length, as I believe a relatively concise story, as in the case of Kong, can be told in less time. The Skull Island definitely had its irreplaceable moments of interest but I felt as if plenty of them were merely 'space-fillers'. In attempt to bring on as many exotic depictions of its mysterious fauna as possible, they occasionally didn't pay much attention to logic: e.g. a herd of, what, twenty or so Brontosauruses running from several Venatosauruses; three giant Vastatosauruses engage in a desperate fight with Kong to devour Ann who is hardly enough of a food to even one V-rex; Jimmy shoots the Wetas away from Driscoll but doesn't hit him with a single bullet... and I'd name a few more events, which I can't recall right now. The movie sometimes "boasts" with exoticism and knowledge on paleozoology when really it would have fared better if it exposed less of mere imagery of the Skull Island and more of story and logic.
