Actually good movie for women and men

I thought this was going to be another stoner movie but it was actually a good movie with a really well-written script. It was funny, heartwarming, and thoughtful. The jokes were intelligent. The acting was genuine and not forced. I liked how the female characters were realistically empowering and didn't take BS from the men but not in a cliche way. This was really enjoyable for both me and my boyfriend.
