Cars Stunts Action :Spectacular And Blast
When you watch a movie you must know the type of the movie like the Fast and Furious franshine that its all about cars and stunts and action , I am a huge fan of the franshine since Fast Five and its keep growing bigger and bigger for example they destroy 200 cars for a bank vault in Fast Five then in Furious 6 they got a Tank then what they want to do something bigger !they drop a real cars with parachutes !!! This is why i love this franshine because the amazing stunts ... Furious 7 like the previous two the story is stupid and over the top but the stunts are amazing and they destroy 230 cars for the movie like Maserate 2014 and Aston Martin Db9 2008 and Nissan Gtr 2012 and Lykan Hypersport 2014 and many many cars ... and the beginning of the movie is solid when Jason Statham (Deckard shaw) is talking to his brother Owen shaw after he kills the black ops guys and destroy the hospital and the soundtrack (Payback) was amazing And the first chase sequences between Dom and Deckard it was amazing and end with a huge collision then Mr.nobody come and save Dom and he wanted him for a mission to a bring Ramsay The Hacker because she created a device that find anybody in the world and to find shaw .at this point the story become a rescue mission than a revenge plot ... and the mountain scenes is the best in the movie because great stunts and cameras work and they destroy 50 cars for that scenes ... and in Abu Dahbi we saw The Lykan Hypersport jumping between two towers and it was fantastic... and we saw another chase sequences Between Dom and Deckard this time Dom with his iconic muscle car the Beast Dodge Charger 1970 and Shaw with the British car Aston Martin Db9 2008 and end with a collision but this time the Charger win ... at the end Deckard Shaw goes to secured prison and of curse he will back in Furious 8. and despite his short time in the movie. Jason Statham was a Badass Villain and i hope he gets more time in Furious 8... And of curse we don't forget Tony jaa he was amazing in his tow fight scence with Paul walker but unfortunately he die. and Ronda Rousy also her fight scence with Letty was greet ... and the final tribute for Paul walker was amazing and emotional and the Wiz khalifa song see you again make you cry and forgot the movie , and we saw a final ride between Dom charger and Paul walker real car Toyota Supra ... So for me Furious 7 is the best one in series i know it over the top but the Cars and Stunts and Action is the best in while.....
