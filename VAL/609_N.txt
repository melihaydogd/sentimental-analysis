Maybe the IDEA is not bad, but the movie is a disgrace
I don't really side with the reviewers that say the idea of a movie like this would be lame. Because honestly, there'd be nothing better than taking your kid to see a movie that makes them think about how they work. Bright colourful visuals, lovable animals inside our head in a big mind world. It could have been so cool. However, this movie has NONE of that. It makes your inside of your head look like a stupid office worker's counter, what gives?

If this were done in the 90s, we would have had a HUGEEEEEE story about jaguars and cheetahs and fish and stuff in our mind. Showing kids just how BIG you are inside, and how your gears that operate you are big things. Not some boring set of plastic characters. Plastic referring to the term from Mean Girls (it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, see it if you don't know the term "plastic"). The emotions all look like plastics, especially Joy. There's a way to 3D model a character in a movie to have a proper kid movie physique. Joy looks like a plastic anorexic. What with all the slang and annoying sarcasm bratty attitudes too. You want your kids seeing that? Back then in a Bug's Life, our kids got to see Princess Atta having a normal girl's figure, Dot her little sister actually had kiddy cheeks, this main girl character in Inside Out is a PLASTIC. PLASTIC I TELL YOU.

She gets into the biggest plastic arguments with her parents, I never did that nonsense and no one from the 90s did that stuff. Typical mean kid with a cell phone. The day animated movies FROM PIXAR FOR GOD'S SAKE, have the main character being like 12 with a cell phone? Cell phone when you're under 30 would have been bad back in the 90s. Heck I think even at my age you can't have a cell phone without your mother poking fun at you.

This ties back to another point, that animated movies now are using humans as the characters. Why? What did animals ever do to you? Clearly these movie makers now are not from that era when we had beautiful characters like Mufasa, Woody, Sully, Hopper, etc. Where are the villains in this movie? Where's the Kevin Spacey acting? Where's Scar? No one cool? Just some miniskirt plastic punching the dinner table and upsetting her parents? I never did that stuff. Humans as main characters in animated movies DO NOT usually make good film material.

Not to mention the whole movie was ridden with high school references, typical plastic stuff. It was so boring I luckily was there when it was on at home, I could just leave the room while the other's watched. Never show this to your kids. It makes them think their world is microscopic and its ran by desk clerks. The "emotion" characters really aren't funny or likable, they are NOT cute like Dot from a Bug's Life or Boo from Monsters Inc, they SUCK. And the whole "I'm a teen so I don't talk to my parents" thing was forbidden before. Now it's the main subject of the movie? Makes you wonder what this movie maker looks like who made the movie. What the heck are they? Hoodlums? I don't know.

You makers need to take a pen and jot down full essays about what makes Lion King so good, Scar so menacing. Kovu from the second Lion King so cool, what makes Heimlick funny from a Bug's Life, what makes Zee a hero from Antz, the list goes on. Such a boring offensive movie. There's so many adult themes I've left out.

Trying to turn our beautiful wide eyed hyper children into antisocial desk clerk emotion hormone teens that don't talk to their Mommy and Daddy anymore. My kids were never like this.
