Loved it.
This may be one of the most important super hero films of our time. Especially with the current climate we are in with politics & civil rights. This film was so important as well as amazing. Enjoyed every minute of it. Can't wait til part 2. Want to see what more is in store for Black Panther. Great job to all of the actors!!!!
