Theatrical wasteland of ideas

Well, no. I really don't get all the excitement regarding this movie. It begins rather pretentious with the inner turmoils of max, but that's the deep part. What follows is a few great ideas wasted in a bad script. I like great action. I like steam punk/metal rigged/vehicle based stuff, the mad max premise, the society after the destroyed world, the weirdo things like the guitar rig...but not in this concoction.

Make a choice, then go for that. The action is great, but the rest falls flat, like the characters. Max isn't the lead character and feels like a stupid ox. The development of his character isn't there to support his actions later on. Furiosa is the main character and has some spirit. The evil guy is just that. And the boy is to recognizable as that guy that plays it, what's his name...

The action in this movie is great, the chase intense, but that all stops when they get to the mothers...oh my, from then on the scriptwriters must have thought 'well, let's put some emotion in here'. And that is the failure, I think. They wanted action, story and emotional development/attachment. The last failed miserably, the story is hidden somewhere beneath rubble and the action doesn't hold because of the first fail. Sadly.

So, great ideas, nice pictures, but bad execution.
