I was fooled by the rating
The movie was shouting so loud to catch attention and it certainly did. Too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards... 3D did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plot.

From the beginning it was clear to me that the movie won't jump high enough and come up to my expectations, all I had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be - explosions, dorky costumes, pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded Hollywood.

Surely when the Avengers came out and I saw the rating (8.8 ?!), I assumed that I was wrong. Such great score! I just had to see this magnificent, most brilliant movie ever.

Time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly. Not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture, but they could have added a little bit of originality too. No matter how I look at it, some scenes and ideas resemble Transformers 3.

This was not brilliant at all. Perhaps when overjoyed comic lovers settles down the Avengers will reach its true rating and be remembered as another common Hollywood's trash.

As for now I can only weep for my money.
