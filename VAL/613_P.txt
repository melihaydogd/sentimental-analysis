So, you are telling me Romance movies can also be smart?
After the first 15 minutes I thought I was watching a lesser versi√≥n of "Before Sunset", with sci-fi touches. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a masterpiece on every facet of cinema. The story is complex, with an original structure and super natural and deep dialogue. The acting from the protagonists was amazing (hard to believe this was the same actress that made Titanic, and even Jim Carrey disappears on the role, except for two or three moments). Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Dunst weren't that great (in smaller roles) and the rest of the cast was serviceable/good. The score couldn't possibly be better (well, maybe it could've been, but it was still great). This is an extremely romantic movie with sci fi touches that makes easier to get into the philosophical and existential themes they approach, all without losing anything in the entertainment department
