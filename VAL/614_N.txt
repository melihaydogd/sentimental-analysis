Overrated
Typical Hollywood sensationalism.

A movie made with guns and fighting to sell tickets.

Mindless shallow entertainment. 

it should have been a television movie. 

How it got the acclaim it did is beyond me?

The acting is self indulgent , John Wayne ,American fantasy.

It must have been heavily financed in the promotion department.

There is such a lack of quality writing they have to rely on sensationalism to illustrate the very serious issues of the pharmaceutical industry.

Not well depicted nevertheless.

Feels like a waste of time
