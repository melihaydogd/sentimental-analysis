Makes Revenge of the Fallen look like a Best Picture winner...
I just don't get it. Stephen Sommers "bounces back" from the colossal disaster Van Helsing, only to give us something worse. The fact that this piece of s**t took $170 million to make is more talked about than the movie itself, and for good reason. When you spend that much money on a film it usually at least looks like money well spent, despite Sommers (look what the same studio Paramount did with $30 million Cloverfield). Guess what, writing doesn't cost that much money, and clearly there was no real effort in that department. Why, when you can spend some of that money on insane practical stunts and create memorable sequences like some other directors do, would you spend it on creating bases under polar ice caps and the sands of Egypt, which look like cartoon sequences edited into live - action? The CGI was BAD, very bad. The action was (as expected) non stop, stereotype and irritating. The stunts were non – existent, as everything was CG. The women kick more arse than everyone else. The Paris sequence was pretty much everything you see in the trailers and clips, disappointing when you see the whole thing instead of quick cuts. It was always obvious that this film would hide a lack of substance with style, but quite frankly it was not very stylish. Snake Eyes is sadly immensely under used, Channing Tatum is the worst actor I've seen since Hayden Christensen, pathetic musical score, pathetic dialogue and attempts at humor even from the usually – funny Marlon Wayans, completely non – memorable performances from everyone else, Dennis Quaid might as well have not been in the movie, for everyone who's watched the trailers and exclusive clips, that's pretty much all there is in the movie. It is, at best, pathetic (even by Stephen Sommers summer blockbuster standards). Hard to think Stuart Beattie could write a screenplay this bad, you'll see what I'm talking about if you're unfortunate enough to watch the characters' so – called "back stories" and the now requisite "leading onto a sequel" ending. Cheesy, cheap - looking (which I still cannot comprehend), not cool, worse than sister concern Revenge of The Fallen, and I have a horrible feeling Stephen Sommers may have destroyed a potentially mind – blowing franchise even before it kicks off. Since every other franchise seems to be doing it these days, who knows, maybe a "reboot" with another director? Unheard of for a second film, I know, but this is how bad it is and I do not want to see it die before it's born. Saving grace (if there is such a thing for this film):

Ray Park as Snake Eyes (his costume more than anything, since they wasted his presence and potential) Brendan Fraser's second – long cameo, which I personally enjoyed more than the whole movie, the concepts in the movie, which sadly were taken to a Sommers – ish level in terms of execution & Sienna Miller & Rachel Nichols (not their pathetic ten - second fight sequence)
