A disappointment
Kung Fu Panda 3 is good, but it could have been great. That's a shame. The core of the movie is solid, with enough of both heart-warming and heart-stopping moments, but the majority of the movie is really unfunny filler. As per usual, the majority of the cast have maybe two lines in the entire movie, far too much time is devoted to slapstick shenanigans and most of the plot is info-duped at the end.

The story is an almost beat-for-beat recreation of Kung Fu Panda 2. A new villain has shown up (in this case Kai, the Spirit Warrior who can steal people's chi) and Po must learn a new spell in order to defeat him. The Five are completely useless, Shifu is completely useless, Po is completely useless right up until the end when victory is handed to him by Deus Ex Machina. There's enough plot there for a 20-minute TV episode, but it's stretched into a barely 90-minute movie by judicious padding.

If you don't mind a movie wasting your time and its own potential with what feels like an eternity playing with the pandas, you'll find enough to be engaged. There are themes of self-identification, familial bonds, friendship and even coming of age... Again. The voice actors are talented and able to give gravitas to frankly amateurish writing, the visuals are beautiful enough to bring a tear to the eye and there's a surprising amount of action to be found. It's just a shame that all of that couldn't be put in an entire movie.

The original Kung Fu Panda was great because it played to the beats of an old bootleg Hong Kong Kung Fu movie of the sort Jackie Chan might have starred in back in the 80s. Its final lesson, at the end of the day, was a simplistic but heartfelt "believe in yourself" as Po the Dragon Warrior had only to look at himself and his own strength to defeat adversity. Kung Fu Panda 2 - and now Kung Fu Panda 3 - make the mistake of hinging everything on magical powers which are inevitably given to Po so he can win and so that character development can be dropped onto him. In the meantime, Tigress and the others only serve to get beaten up so the villain looks more menacing.

Bizarrely enough, Kung Fu Panda 3 could use less "Panda" and more "Kung Fu."
