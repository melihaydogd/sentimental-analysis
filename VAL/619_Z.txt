A classic, but not perfect
Fritz Lang's M is undoubtedly one of cinema's most influential works. It set a precedent for all thrillers that would follow. It demonstrates the properties of mis en scene with expertise and style. But it is not a perfect film. Certainly, I am biased due today's higher standards for story telling through film, but M is cinema at its basics, and as such, it feels very simplified.

The story is very straight forward; there is a child-killer on the loose and both the cops and the crooks are out to get him. But I feel the film suffers because of this. There is no expansion on the themes of the story and the message is practically told to you in the film's last line rather than gradually developed throughout the entire film. It is this kind of simplification that leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied. While it would be unfair to go so far as to call it shallow, M offers no depth in terms of story or characters.

The characters in general are barely even developed. With the exception of Peter Lorre's Beckett, we are not given time to understand who the characters are. Each scene we meet a new major dialog character, and most of the time, we never see them again. While Lang and writer Thea von Harbou did an admirable job indicating who we were supposed to view as the good guys, they did not give the audience time to connect with the more important characters, like the missing child's mother, or the police captain. This leaves the viewer feeling more detached and less likely to respond to the film. The performances are also over the top, a practice that was left over from the silent era.

The story itself is rather poorly paced, or rather, it could have been edited better. With the story rarely intercutting between the police's investigation into the child-killer and the criminal's hunt for the murderer, the film should have more individual scenes, thus creating a more rapid and intense sense of suspense. The transitions themselves between the scenes could have been improved as well. Lang makes frequent use of the fade technique (a technique that is often overused in many classic films), thus creating a sense of dreaminess. Whether this was his intention or not, I feel that it is distracting and further detaches the viewer from the emotional content of the film.

Perhaps the most noticeable element that is missing from the picture is music. This has more to do with the emergence of talkies than it does with anything else. It was felt by most film makers at the time that the music that had provided most of the emotion of the old silents would be too distracting and create clutter in a film in which there is a practical soundtrack. But it is in the use of 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' that proves to be one of the most innovative aspects of the film. Not only does it serve as a plot point, with it being used to point out the killer, but it set a trend of associating musical cues to identify to the viewer who the protagonist and who the antagonists were and when they were influencing the story.

The other notable aspect of the film is Peter Lorre's performance. Through his portrayal of Hans Beckert, we learn to sympathize with the killer. We are drawn in by his pleas for mercy, and we can feel his fear as the crooks search for him in the bank building. The lighting of his character is also particularly effective, as it always keeps him in the shadows, creating a mood of foreboding whenever we see him (or his shadow, for that matter).

Again, I am viewing this from the perspective of a time in which tastes and standards are vastly different than in the time that M was made. But I can still see why this film is held in such high regard. Without it, modern thrillers would not be where they are today. Influence that it has on modern cinema is irreplaceable. And the theme of the film, unfortunately, still rings true.
