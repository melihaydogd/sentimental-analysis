Mentioning of Dumbledore twice doesn't make it Harry Potter
Why was this movie made? I really do not know. More money from the Harry Potter success, milking the cow? Did the American public need a Harry Potter style movie on their soil? For sure it wasn't to make a good story, because if there is something this movie lacks it is a descent and logical plot. Compared to the Harry Potter movies it is full of flat, meaningless and predictable characters and events. The magic duels never come close to the original movies. All the references to the original movies (*mentioning Dumbledore and Hogwarth once or twice) are meaningless and unnecessary and clearly only to make sure people do not forget it is a Harry Potter spin-offIt is not often I fall asleep during a movie...this time it happened...once...rewind...twice..rewind...and almost a third time but fortunately I was rescued by the end of the movie...well almost, I switched off the "emotional" ending
