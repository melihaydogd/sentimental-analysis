Almost unwatchable at times
Almost unwatchable at times, this Scandinavian tour de force goes way beyond where you want to go and for what? It is inconceivable that this complicated, deranged, filthy, noisy and objectionable film could have been put together so convincingly without there being real and genuine anger to express. We have a father making porno in the lounge whilst his son takes no part and barely leaves his room. The girl is used and abused and comes back for more. It transpires that the son's mother died in a car crash when he was four and we later learn that the crazed and desperate father was raped by his father as a boy. There are digs at reality TV, cosmetic surgery and violence against women but surely most of this brutal journey is Mr Moodysson trying to tell us something about himself. And that is really scary - Bataille would have loved it!
