Sit back and enjoy the show.
I am always amazed at how many reviewer seem to pick apart and over analyze movies looking for all kinds of hidden meanings and some deep backstory. I think most people just watch films for the shear entertainment value. This movie was just a fun to watch with some adventure, a relationship story line, some parts of just craziness, suspense and laughs. Gee what a concept! And since it is not full of cussing, sex and killing should attract a larger audience to enjoy it. Some critics have written it too far-fetched and not believable. Sure, but no more than all the totally unbelievable adventure movies that have such fantastic action stunts that no human could possible live through. Hey their movies. Sit back, relax and enjoy. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.
