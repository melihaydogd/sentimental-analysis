Go to sleep instead
Wow, a bank robbing movie with little interest.

What do you think will happen? Not much. It's a lame film with little development and no funny or catchy lines.

No real action and it just drags.

If this is quality film making in the 1970's - then they had some pretty low standards around that time.

The robbery and everything that happened in the bank and around the bank was a total letdown.

So boring...why did I bother to waste my time watching it? Oh...cause I was too lazy to turn the TV off.
