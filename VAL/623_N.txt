Terrible!
What were they thinking? this is the worst version of the Classic Jane Austen novel ever! I love Jane Austen and so does my mother. We were excited to see how well they portrayed the story of the five Bennet sisters. WHat a disappointment! Really! We couldn't stop laughing at the horrible acting and the goofy characters. The costumes were terrible, the people chosen were terrible! Not only that, but we were bored out of our minds during the whole film! It was the biggest waste of 10 bucks, not to mention the two hours of my life that I will never ever get back! Jane Austen would consider this a slap in the face. I also didn't think that Kiera Knightly's acting couldn't get any worse from Pirates. but guess what? I was wrong! I'll admit it--I was very wrong. She hit the bottom of the barrel with this movie.  The truly great version of this novel is the 1995 BBC mini-series starring Colin Firth. The characters are superbly played and the scenery is just beautiful. This version is so perfect, I give it a 20! Shame on everyone who enjoyed the 2005 version! Shame on you all!
