Awesome!
Loved it! It was innovative, funny, and personal. The humor and the stories were heart felt and I loved his use of pictures in the background to illustrate his stories. One of the best comedy shows I've seen in a while. I love humor that comes from real life stories. Its more relatable and hysterical. Enjoyed every minute of it.
