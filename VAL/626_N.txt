Horrendous
Many of the negative comments so far have already said what I want to say. That is, sure, the animation and the backgrounds are wonderful. But that almost makes the film even worse, it feels like a lost chance at making a very good film with both great animation *and* a good script. I found this film severely lacking in that last department. I can not understand why it is ranked so high on the top 250 (at the time of writing this around spot 40). None of the characters' actions seem motivated and they are very badly developed. It seems like the person responsible for the "story" here just throw a lot of 'cute' and weird characters in and made the whole thing an obvious reference to Alice in Wonderland and thought the rest would solve itself. It didn't. The end result is that you just don't care. The pace is very slow. A lot of things may happen but the film doesn't draw you in. I think that many of the problems with the film "Princess Mononoke" was repeated in this anime. I thought this was so bad it was provocative, I wanted to leave before I had seen half of it, but I sat in the middle of the row so I endured the rest and the movie never got any better. My rating: 1/10.
