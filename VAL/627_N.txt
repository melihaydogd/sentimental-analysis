Totally Baffling
If you have any clue what is going on in this movie you are the new Einstein. Its like the writers have taken the loose pages of 2001 a space odyssey, Star Wars and perhaps Whalley?,threw them up in the air together, picked them up randomly and used them as the screen play. The plot is very poorly explained making the film very hard to follow. The story was more of a shoot 'em up computer game than a sci fi movie. If your concentration wavers for a second, you haven't a clue who is who or where they are or when it is happening. Effects are good with a lot of speed scenes and explosions. Acting was OK but the plot was that bad, you don't really care. I couldn't wait to leave the theater.
