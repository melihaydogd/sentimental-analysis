So glad I had low expectations
I was dragged to see "Catwomen" by a mate of mine. I had heard how bad it was, so I had absolutely no expectations of it being on the same planet as anything good. So from this point of view I was neither surprised or disappointed.

Oscar Winner(!) Halle Berry delivers a performance that would make the grade in a daytime soap but not much else. In my opinion she didn't even work as a piece of eye candy, that suit was just ugly. As for the rest Benjamin Bratt was wooden and Sharon Stone, just plain horrible.

Finally the director Pitof (riight) did nothing to even remotely excite. I've had more thrilling maths classes (really I have). Luckily he can use a different name for his next film. (Pitof is a nickname).

I am just so thankful I had low expectations for "Catwomen" or I would be way more angry at it and the people that made it then I am now.
