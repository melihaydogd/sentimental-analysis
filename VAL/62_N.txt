Clint Eastwood is such a BAD director!
So I went through the terrible and horrible experience of watching this "movie". I thought "Spice World" was the worst movie ever, but Clint Eastwood now holds that title with this disgusting "movie". Easily the worst movie my girlfriend or I had ever seen. And between the two of us, we have seen some real winners. I actually enjoyed The Good the Bad and the Ugly. First, a lot of people think this is some kind of grand statement by Eastwood about America just like in The Outlaw Josey Whales. But it's not. It's a mad dash by Eastwood to show you every disgusting image he can think of. Sure it's nasty. But in a nation with G.G. Allin, Eminem, and John Wayne Gacy the shock value is gone. And disgusting for disgusting's sake doesn't make any kind of profound statement. America gives people a wide latitude to be as degenerate as they want. That doesn't make America filthy. Second, the acting is horrible. Half the lines sound like they're being read off the cue cards for the very first time. The other half sound a little better, but they all lack any kind of real inflection or feeling. And the plot... how are these people at a cross road in their life? Somewhere right now, as you're reading this, someone is plotting the torture murder of a child for sexual gratification. How is Clint Eastwood worse off than those people? He's not, and the whores are not even close. The only redeeming quality this movie had was when Daso X starts making his list of wrestling figures. I can't think of a good thing about this movie, except that I've seen it now and won't have to again.
