Special dark/occult/mystery film with lots of potential but really poor presentation of that mystery and lacking explanations...
Metaphysical/mystery film. A group of young people go hiking in the snow, until one of them accidentally discovers a skeleton. Except the skeleton belonged to a "host" for something supernatural, and the young man who discovers him stops responding to his friends and acts strange, as he becomes the new host for that entity. Later we are transferred to the near future and to an independent story where another group of young people listening to a story/reputation, decides to do it for fun and end up invoking The Empty Man, the same entity that is transferred from host to host and that seems to exist a whole cult behind it. Although the film started promisingly, it continued at an increasingly slow pace and grew increasingly boring as time went on, since instead of explaining, things became more and more complicated. No clear explanation was given as to what Empty Man is, and the ending was particularly strange and incomprehensible. Although there could be a particular plot twist, unfortunately like the rest of the film, the twist of the ending further complicates things and the few explanations given to the audience are also overturned. Despite the good performances and the special script and the directing, unfortunately the presentation of the mystery to the viewer was particularly inadequate, so instead of enjoying a special mystery film, the film ends and the audience won't understand what they watched... Too bad not to explain why it had every prospect of becoming a special film in the genre.
