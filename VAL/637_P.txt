You "Critics" are what's wrong with Hollywood.
For years this movie was actually my favorite of all time, or at the very least tied with Bill Murray's "The Life Aquatic". This movie IS NOT A HORROR FILM. Get that ridiculous thought out of your heads people.

In summation, it's a drama that brings characters to the brink of self-destruction in a Dogmatic Catholic universe (e.g. Vatican City). This is a pseudo-exorcism movie, insofar that there are exorcisms of a sort, but then you are made to think about the repercussions.

The CGI is cheesy, but this is circa 2003, probably went in production in 2002. We didn't even have iPods back then, and the smartest phone you could get was a Blackberry, with a Palm Pilot to back it up. There are a couple of lines that seem forced, and I know for a fact that there is a part that I typically fast-forward through to get through the dialogue. All said, this is not an A movie, but definitely more deserving than the D rating most everyone is giving it.

The people who rate this film low are the same ones responsible for the fact that we can EXPECT a new Transformers, Avengers, Twilight, etc. film year after year.
