Horrible, disgusting, movie portraying child violence.
The violence in this movie is so graphic that it is truly disturbing. And the worst part is that some of this disgusting, graphic, violence is perpetrated by a child. What have we come come to in our society when we celebrate a pre-teen child slicing up and killing people with razor sharp claws in a film that is supposed to be entertaining. I have lost all respect for Hugh Jackman because he participated in this disgusting movie. Honestly, I do not understand how anyone could rate this movie above a 3. It should have been X rated for the child violence.
