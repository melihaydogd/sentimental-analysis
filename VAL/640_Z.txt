better watched when younger
I remember this movie to be so much better when I watched it many years ago. Now it has lost its magic, due to the acting of the two leads and outdated effects.

Atreyu's acting was unimpressive. When it came time for him to call out the Gmork the scene looked woeful. Where was the fight, a creature who had destroyed all of Fantasia, saying Atreyu was the last, I lost interest before that but here I had to laugh. It only looked like a scratch on the beast.

And the time it takes Bastian to enter Fantasia.

Better not to watch it later in life, keep whatever memories you have of it earlier. My final remark 'memories' may remind you of the 'next chapter'.
