Overlong Film Puts Audience to Sleep!
Captain America lacks humor, engaging plot and script, relying solely on special effects and promotions to get box office honors! And to make matters worse, it dragged on forever! It was a silent audience for the entire 2 hours, not a chuckle was heard, and when it was finally over, the audience just walked out the door with not a soul staying for credits or musical score.

From start to end, this was just a mish-mash of unengaging computer imagery, with so many scenes of shoot-em-up violence, shattered glass and chaos that it got boring within the first half hour.

Camera work was shaky, editing poor with overly long scenes, and actors either miscast or just reading their lines without impact.And if there was a music score, I sure don't remember it.

And good acting just wasn't there. The CaptainAmerica actor used a faint persona drawn from Tom Cruise, who, with his intensity and charisma, would have raised the movie to a higher level. His strong woman cohort, played by Scarlett Johanson, was especially lackluster, with her only notable expression being frowning occasionally. And, casting an aged Robert Redford as villain was poor casting extraordinaire! Redford lacked energy, intensity, and physical presence as an actor.

If you enjoy watching a Hollywood-style extravaganza with 90% special effects and actors sleep-walking through their lines, Captain America is for you! Even our 14 year-old for whom this movie was probably made, said "we should have gone to Spiderman!"
