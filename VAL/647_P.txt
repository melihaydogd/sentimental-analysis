Fabulous!
I was invited to a screening of this and went expecting to be informed and intellectually stimulated, which I was. But I didn't expect the movie to be so unbelievably entertaining. It starts with the music of Pete Seeger and ends with Billy Bragg, two activist musicians who I greatly admire, but along the way a key scene dances its heart out to Shirley and Company (you'll probably have to look that up).  I suppose I should have anticipated that since the UK Miner's strike of 1984 had already generated one great movie, Billy Elliot (with its own great dance sequence to T Rex), the magic was there to be tapped again. Perhaps it's that Maggie Thatcher makes such a great evil queen villain. But as Shirley sings, "One monkey don't stop no show"  So I urge you to see this and have yourself a grand old time.   This week I've seen three movies that might be classified as message movies, First "Love is Strange" which was all very moving and sentimental but which had so many script problems that at a certain point it was really a chore to ignore them. Then " La Grande Illusion" at MoMA which is certainly well scripted and constructed but ultimately, for me, not very emotionally moving. This movie was so fast and fun and furious that if there were any problems I've long ago forgotten them. And, without a doubt, the message came through strong and clear and fabulous.  I suppose I should warn you that if you get steamed up when you can't understand every word of an 'across the pond' accent, maybe you should wait for a DVD with subtitles.   Also: If you think of Rupert Murdoch is a great Australian er.....Brit.... er .. American... then this movie is not for you. If you think that "Wild Strawberries" provides a template upon which all movies should be based then this movie is not for you. If, however, you thought that "Kinky Boots" was not quite RED! enough (there's a double entendre there) then buy a ticket to this and have a ball!
