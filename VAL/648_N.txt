Yes Man: What a Disappointment
I have always loved Jim Carrey's movies and a good laugh was guaranteed but this movie was so contrived that it was embarrassing. I can honestly say I did not laugh once. If that is what the director calls "wit" then he has taken a backward step since "The Break-Up" which was moderately funny.

The message is a good one but it has been executed so badly that it really becomes cringeworthy at times. Zooey Deschanel is only shining light in this movie but some of the lines also make her look ordinary at times.

Save your money, hire another flick.
