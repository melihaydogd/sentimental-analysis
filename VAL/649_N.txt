 Would You Die Already!
Okay everybody knows that the movie was way to long, it should have been cut to about the time they party made it to the Elven kingdom. The movie could have saved a bit of time by letting the characters die a little more quickly... but Noooo, the characters have to give their final death line... and then another... and then another... and yet again... and then die. And did they really have to show all the scenes of them walking or running or boating for so long with the camera zooming over every hill and rock following them, I liked the country side bit it was a bit much. I am a fan of the books but I have to admit the movie did open my eyes about the series. Its about walking... a lot. And dieing slowly. Well the later of the two was the movie not the book. Personally I want my money back plus interest for making me watch all the extra footage that was not needed.
