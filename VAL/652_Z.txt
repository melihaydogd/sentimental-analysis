Mediocre crime thriller is elevated by a good ending
What's so special about Se7en? As a fan of crime thrillers (Zodiac is one of my favourite modern films) I expected this to be mind blowing. It's a pretty standard mystery that's way too long. It's alright, certainly not a classic. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman deliver solid performances, although it's not enough to save this largely forgettable thriller. The ending bunks this film up to a 6/10.
