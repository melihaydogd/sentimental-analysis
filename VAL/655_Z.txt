So what?
I left the screening after almost two hours, because I did not realize what this movie wants to tell. Yes, there is fine acting (Bruno Ganz is really great!) and it seems to be authentic, but for what is it good for, to watch the suicide of some nazi monsters? It tells you nothing, except that these people remain true to their principles until death. It tells you nothing about their crimes, it tells you nothing about their powers. It tells you only something about their characters, what nobody needs to know. The movie is also a tightrope walk, because it shows the destroying of Berlin, it shows many victims and it shows the Nazis trapped in the FÃ¼hrerbunker. Someone might get the impression, all the disaster is coming from the Allies, which try to conquer Berlin.
