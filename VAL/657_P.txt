Great Director & Film
Loved the film, story was good, scenes shot were well executed, and feel it showed Cuba in a very realistic manner. Story is touching and uplifting and would be a great view on HBO or a typical film Weinstein would buy and make sure that it got distributed and seen all over. Also comes to mind the thought that the US blockade of this small island is purely a venomous act that serves no purpose to either parties the US & Cuba, and is really shameful on the US. Ian Padron's directing was wonderful and to make a film like this with the budget that was allowed was amazing. My hat is off Ian Padron and I hope to see more films to come from this great director
