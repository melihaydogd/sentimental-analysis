Don't Cast Corpses
The good news about The Only Living Boy in New York is that it features an A-list supporting cast who are consistently appealing and engaging. It also features some great cinematography and lovely NYC locations.

What it totally lacks is an engaging narrative. The title reeks of "coming of age" but there is no discovery or awakening here. The lead character, a millennial nitwit whose name I do not remember, is mired in post-high school inertia, but there is nothing here to suggest that he's actually struggling with that inertia. Rather, he seems content in his inertia, which leaves the narrative with nowhere to go.

But this is largely due to the casting of this Callum fellow. (Sorry, I do not recall his last name and I don't care enough to open a new browser window and look it up.) Once upon a time there was a highly touted you actor named Josh Hartnett, who was incredibly dull, and lifeless, and, well, inert, who has blessedly disappeared from cinema...and this Callum fellow seems to be his clone. He excels at posturing, but to repeat a hackneyed current term - there's no there there. Inert. Boring. The exact opposite of engaging.

On top of which his romantic opposite is Kate Beckinsale - undeniably beautiful, but also undeniably cold. There is a reason that the centerpiece of her acting career has been playing (repeatedly) a vampire, and that is the same reason why she does not appeal as a romantic lead. To touch her is to be frozen in ice.

Whoops - Callum Turner. I didn't have to Google it. It's printed just on the left of this web page. Callum Turner. Please, pass him by in future castings.

Inertia does not cinema make.
