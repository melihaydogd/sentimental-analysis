Don't believe the hype
I'd been nagged by friends and colleagues for years to watch this movie, face-palms all around - they couldn't believe I hadn't seen one of the best movies of all time.

I have a 30min rule for movies, if it's rubbish I turn it off to avoid wasting my life on a bad movie. As this one came with such a high regard, I gave it a full hour and then was forced to turned it off.

Don't ask me how it ended, it was so dull and boring I really don't care. It was slow, I found myself falling asleep and I've never before watched a comedy with no laughs. Reading the other reviews, I wonder if we were watching the same movie.

I watched "Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li" earlier this year just for fun as it had such poor reviews and ratings. Sadly I enjoyed it more than this "classic".

Whoever invented the "dark comedy" genre should be put against a wall and shot.
