French corn
Often I wonder at how much better films made in continental Europe often seem to be than typical English-language movies; of course, part of the explanation may simply be that, as a resident of England, one only tends to see the best of European cinema. And as if to prove the point, here comes 'Hertabreaker', a film whose sole raison d'etre appears to be to demonstrate that the French can make a romantic comedy every bit as drearily predicable as the Americans. All the expected elements are here: the grand wedding, the affluent backdrop, the preposterously constructed plot, the nymphomaniac best friend, the character who falls in love without meaning to, the heavy reliance on a familiar soundtrack, and of course, the eventual, inevitable choice between two very different men. Just as predictable is the absence of any real laughs. Right at the end, I did wonder if the film was going to surprise me with a departure from the normal ending for this kind of rubbish; I won't spoil the plot by stating whether or not it did, but I will say that by this point, I was well past caring either way.
