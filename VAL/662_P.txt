It wasn't the disaster I thought it would be.
After reading comments on IMDb, I actually expected the film to be much worse than what I thought it would be, but it wasn't the disaster I thought it would be, I will admit the film has few really dumb scenes but I really like the concept, the main flaw lies primarily in the execution, which could have been done ten times better.

Lindsey Lohan's performance was average, the guy who plays the piano teacher in my opinion, was actually the worse actor in the whole film, the problem with Lohan's acting was her reactions especially when she's supposed to be shocked she is completely stoned faced, Overall, it has the concept but not the execution, it could probably have done with a better cast and better direction, but I like it for the concept, 7 out of 10, for the concept alone
