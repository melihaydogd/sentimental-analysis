Fast and furious for people who like good movies
Movie about cars going really fast, but every shot looks like great concept art, and the characters all have great development. Most of the CGI is great, but some is shoddy. I don't really care because it works with the cartoony fun of the action. Don't listen to the soundtrack while driving.
