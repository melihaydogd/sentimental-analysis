Didn't do Anything for Me,
Under the Skin is a very poor movie with a terribly written storyline and a mediocre cast. It dosen't actually have a plot, we're just watching a woman seduce a bunch of men, luring them away with her, and then something strange happens, that's pretty much it, the character does this to about eight men and the movie is over. It's suppose to be a psychological thriller, and it is, but it never actually thrilled or terrified me mentally, which is clearly what these types of movies are meant to do, the main character is never developed, we aren't made very clear of her motives until the end of the film, which could have been an exciting thing to keep the audience interested, it probably did for some people, but I had no interest in it whatsoever and simply found her suspiciousness irritating. Scarlett Johansson tries her best with this role, but she couldn't save it, it's a tedious film that you will leave having understood just as much as you did about it when you started. Boring, drawn out and confusing, I wouldn't recommend Under the Skin to anyone. Several men think their in luck when a beautiful woman approaches them, but she has a dark secret.Best Performance: Scarlett Johansson Worst Performance: Adam Pearson
