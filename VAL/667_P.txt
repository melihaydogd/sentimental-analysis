I don't usually like these films but...
If there's one film of this type to watch with your girlfriend or romantic friend this is the one. I'm on a mission to watch all of the imdb top 250 and I was over 50% done when I came to this title. I put it on and expected to have it playing on the side while I was browsing the web but after the first couple minutes I knew I stumbled upon something special. It really is a romantic suspense film. You want them to be together but at the same time it sends a message to let yourself live in the moment and be happy with what is going on now, without trying to extend it. It's really a film you can think about and discuss for a long time. The exceptional dialog drives the film and you can tell the chemistry between the actors is something special or else it wouldn't work. Definitely something I actively recommend to people in my life.
