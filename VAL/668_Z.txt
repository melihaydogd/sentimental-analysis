Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse: And with that the Oscars lose the last bit of credibility they had
Where could I even dream to begin on this one? An animated Spiderman film that sits at time of writing as the 41st highest rated movie on IMDB and won an Oscar? Who'd have thought such a thing was possible?So the movie has been hyped left, right, center and diagonally, I've literally not heard one single bad thing about it but the facts mentioned above left me stunned! What could this possibly be to be heralded in such a way?Telling the story of a young man who is also bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superpowers. Kingpins latest dastardly scheme is tearing the fabrics of reality apart and alternate universe versions of Spiderman have all ended up in the same universe. I'm sure you can work out what happens next.So the animation style is a tweak on Pixar, it plays out like a comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn't work for me. The animation doesn't flow fluidly, it looks hokey, disjointed and I found myself frustrated by it.The plot is a novel concept and I liked it, the delivery however I did not. Certain aspects make very little sense, sure it's a Spiderman film so I'm not supposed to think about it too much but I did and my conclusions were migraine inducing stupidity. Did I say stupidity? Oh the stupid doesn't end there sadly, I get the multiverse concept of anything is possible but their Spiderman variant choices were bafflingly dumb and what you'd expect from a Saturday morning cartoon not a blockbuster film!It tries to be heartfelt, but comes across half-assed.
It tries to be funny, but comes across childish.
It tries to be action packed but the style of animation didn't allow it to be done justice.Okay I'm slating the film right now so it probably sounds like I hated it, which I didn't. 6/10 is a fair rating and suggests its above average and it is. But I'm annoyed at the acclaim that's it's been bathed in.8.6 rating on IMDB are you kidding me? And the Oscars have lacked credibility in my eyes for years because of their ridiculous bias and genre-snubbing but this right here is the last bit of credibility up in smoke. I'm not saying a superhero movie shouldn't be Oscar worthy, but this silly cartoon simply isn't (And neither is Black Panther but I'll resist the urge to rant).Into the Spider-Verse to me is no different than all the straight to DVD Marvel and DC efforts we see a couple of each year. The only difference here is the animation style, nothing else sets it apart.I just don't get the appeal.The Good:Some great writingGreat ideaThe Bad:Animation hardly flowsUnexpectedly sillyPlot holes that are unforgivably stupid
