Poor story, great performances
This movie has a very poor story, and a terrible direction. What makes the movie survive is Govinda's BRILLIANT comic performance as "chacha ji". Sanjay Dutt plays well, but Govinda takes the show. He is the best in the movie, and makes you laugh like hell. Nice movie to take away your stress... not only once, but every time you see it!!!
