Fun to watch, good for a few laughs, but way too over my head.
I would say this movie is for certain people who are smart enough to remotely understand what actually happen back in 2007.

The Big Short uses comedy bits in which they would get people to explain complex finance to the dim crowd (like Margot Robbie explains triple A loans while bathing in a bath tub). I'll be honest with you, I did not fully understand, but that is not important.

The style of them explaining it to you is to grab the attention of the people who got screwed or just felt screwed because the banks screwed up and screwed us.

It's one of those movies that gets the Left wing cheering cause it smartly exposes something we all already know.

The best part of the movie was actually the performances of the actors. Steve Carell is known for his comedic acting, and he's able to take that talent and put it into a drama, easily. Christian Bale's awkward genius was genius and brought some steady humor. While Ryan Gosling was the key element of this movie. He was charming and likable even though he was playing the guy we should all hate.

Overall, it was a great attempt by director Adam McKay to dress up a serious movie as a comedy, And it is really easy to like cause he's exploiting everyone's harsh feeling on the Real estate bubble burst.
