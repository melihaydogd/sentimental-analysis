Annoying
Maybe it's entertaining for some, but I can't get over the lazy, cliche writing. Constantly drunk flight attendant drinking vodka on a flight and sleeping with passengers? Really? They could have tried a bit harder, as a former FA The character is uterly annoying and none of the motivations are believable or really even probable which doesn't even let me enjoy the comedy part of it. The characters, especially the "crew" are a bunch of stereotypes, the music is overly dramatic and the split screen gets old.
