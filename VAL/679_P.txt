"Under the Tuncan Sun" by Audrey Wells is a wonderful story of people who start their lives over after suffered a broken heart. The Italian scenario was spectacular during the whole movie along with the music. The houses, the people, the trees and the beach was very fascinating. In the movie, Frances (Diane Lane) was a middle aged women who finds out her husband cheated on her with a younger women. During the divorce, her lawyer advised her that her husband wanted the house as an alimony from the divorce. Patty, Frances friend, was very worried about her health. She treats her to gay trip to Tuscany as a gift. In Tuscany, Francis spontaneously did buy a home and during the process of remodeling, she gained a surrogate family. The house became a metaphor of the transformation and growth process that happened to her in her life. She learned that everything she ever wanted in her life she already had it.
