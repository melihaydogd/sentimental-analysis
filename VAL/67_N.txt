Oh, will this movie just give us a break?
I'll admit up front, I'm not a huge chick flick fan, there are only pretty much a dozen that I like, I normally love the romantic comedies, despite how cheesy they can be. Well, a friend told me while I was renting this on the phone that it was a cheesy movie but I figured, some like sausage and some like pepperoni per say, some movies really do depend on your view of the film. But this was a chick flick that was majorly rubbed in my face and could be at times very predictable.Kathleen is a newly divorced woman who has been cheated on, she goes to Tuscany, Italy and buys a house that is falling apart. She gets immigrants to help her restore it while she works on a new novel hoping to achieve a happy new life. She meets an Italian charmer, who of course I could tell from the line "I could swim in your eyes" that he was... well, you'll get the idea. She goes through some rough times, but pulls herself together when her pregnant friend, Patti moves in with her.Under the Tucsan Sun is a very over the top chick flick that I wasn't at all impressed with, the only thing I'm giving points on that it had some very beautiful pictures in it and it had nice touches to it. But I really do think that Dianne is an over rated actress, again, I know I am going to get bashed for that, but I want to be honest. For women who only enjoy chick flicks, be my guest, but if you're the average film fanatic, I'm not sure if you'll be too impressed by it.3/10
