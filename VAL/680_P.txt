Edward Norton's breakout role
This is a film that really delves into mentally unstable criminals and if they are for real or faking it. And how a somewhat idealistic lawyer that actually has a conscience trying not to send someone who he thinks shouldn't be completely accountable for a crime sent to go through the death penalty. He is someone that really does believes in innocent until proved guilty system. He is the type of idealist that want to believe that there is good in people. And he is played superbly by Richard Gere who is known for playing rich or successful businessmen. But the performance that really stood out to me was Edward Norton's acting, by playing these boy scout altar boy with issues. His performance was actually very believable to the point you can see why the character played by Richard Gere would fall into it. The detective aspects and the courtroom thriller parts of it really did mesh together really well in this and the camera work is shot in a interesting way. This movie does start off a bit slow, but it does pick up later on. So for some audiences it might need some patience to reap the benefits. Overall, it's a very watchable movie but doesn't have enough to make it a stand out classic movie.  7.8/10
