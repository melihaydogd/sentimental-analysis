Season 4
When I heard that SyFy was cancelling the series after 3 seasons I was very surprised. Since the beginning this show has had an excellent story, interesting world building, a great cast and good production values. I thought it was one of the better series on TV, not just science fiction but including all genres. I was gratified to find out that Amazon picked this up and was eagerly awaiting its release. Well, I just finished season 4 and am pleased to announce that the high quality series has returned! My only regret is that for some reason I thought this season was 13 episodes instead of 10 and I wasn't willing for this to be over. I have never read the book(s?) this is based on so that has nothing to do with my review. I will only say that to anyone discovering this series for the first time I envy you! When I saw S4 E10 I got a little sad that it was over. Season 5 looks like it will be fantastic as well!
