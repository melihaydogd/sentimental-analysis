The worse kind of film - no humanity, no point, no logic
I went in to Eagle Eye hoping for a Matrix style modern urban thriller. What I got was something so absurd, that I couldn't quite believe it. When the plot point comes that tries to make sense of the sheer ridiculous insanity you have seen thus far, you will want to believe its not true. That there is another plot point twist yet to come that will be the 'real' reason, and that somehow everything up until now has been a dream or something. But the point doesn't come. It just stays in its ludicrous, logic-less, student screenplay world.

There are no likable characters, no interesting characters, nothing worth caring about, and nothing with any remote sense of 'truth'. Its all simply so absurd that I couldn't connect or relate to any of it. The 'mysterious voice on the phone' that you hear during the trailer, imagine that for about two hours, with nothing else.
