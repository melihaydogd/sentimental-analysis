My Favorite Movie
This is my favorite movie ever. I love everything about it. The cast is perfect, the songs are amazingly written and performed, and the setting is beautiful. When I first saw this movie, I wasn't expecting anything special. I was absolutely wowed. I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this totally surprised me. First of, the plot is really interesting. It follows more of a real life path, with the couple not ending up together, like it does in almost every other movie. This feels more accurate, which makes the movie so much better. Second, the songs are amazing. I could have listened to the playlist over and over again. There is a huge focus on jazz, which is performed beautifully, in so many different ways, not just 'elevator music'. Also, the stars do an amazing job singing, especially since neither of the two main characters didn't start their career in singing. John Legend is great too, for his first real acting debut, and Light A Fire is performed really well. The movie starts off with a music number, Another Day of Sun, which is choreographed and filmed perfectly. Next, all of the shots are amazing, with scenery that really fills up the set. The lighting is also breathtaking, with one scene in particular which is breathtaking. Everything about this movie is perfect.
