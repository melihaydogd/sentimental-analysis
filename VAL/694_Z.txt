Fall of the galactic empire
Well, many people tend to praise this sixth installment of the archifamous franchise, although analyzing it coldly, it is the weakest of the first three.I have always liked Star Wars movies, I have never been a freaky, but as a kid, as almost everyone liked to have the dolls of the movies, posters and all that paraphernalia so well mounted by Lucas, a very intelligent uncle without a doubt in When it comes to making money.In this third installment that concerns us, we have a spectacular start, very well done and exciting. The arrival of both the androids, as Luke himself to Jabba the Hutt's lair, to rescue a captured Leia in her attempt to rescue her beloved Han Solo herself, and who has been turned into a sexy slave with one of the most erotic outfits that have been seen in the history of cinema.All that first initial part, until the destruction of Jabba's ship in the well of the almighty Sarlacc, is masterful, hilarious and unforgettable.So, what prevents me from giving this delivery a higher grade? Very simple, the second half of the film with the arrival of the protagonists in Endor, hits a tremendous downturn that perhaps many do not know or do not want to perceive. Simply the whole teddy bear roll is completely left over because it is too childish and even boring. Until that time Star Wars had been a saga for an adolescent-adult audience, but the inclusion of these ewoks already downgraded it to a movie for kids, which did not have to be, but of course, greater public higher income, Lucas is Very very smart, I've always said it.The development, well, we are told about the final echos that lead to the destruction of the second death star, by Darth Vader, ultimately redeeming himself, the death of Palpatine and the end of the Imperial dictatorship, making the republic and the Restoration of the Jedi as guardians of peace in the galaxy. All this in a spectacular and very emotional climax, with melodies by John Williams during the Luke-Vader clash that freeze the blood, phenomenal and very dark.I, like many others, prefer the original 1983 version, in which Sebastian Shaw appeared at the end as Anakin Skywalker, and not Hayden Cristiansen's mammon, which does not stick with a deadly tail in that scene, since on top The effect is fatal and very forced. I also don't like modern fx additives in some sequences simply because they don't connect well with the visual aspect of the set. But this is just my opinion.It is a great sequel and conclusion of the first trilogy, but due to erroneous decisions that I have commented, some teddy bears making antics and certain highs and lows of rhythm and a not very bright direction of Richard Marquand, tied hand and foot as said by Lucas , which controlled even the smallest aspect of its "toy", as Spielberg once defined it, makes it not so satisfactory and round, since it does not have the opera tone of the first two wonderful parts.
