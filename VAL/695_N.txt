Absolutely boring...what is wrong with Spielberg??
The Post never gets going. Even the parts that they try to make dramatic with music and long long pauses are terribly boring! Tom Hanks continually talks really really fast and Meryl Streep talks really really slow....that's the whole movie...I just saved you 2 hours of your life....please go watch something else...anything.
