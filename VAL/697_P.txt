ONE WORD: Musiccccccc
I love this movie so much I downloaded the soundtrack! I love the concept of what if's v.s. reality! It's such a beautiful film and of course I loved it even more especially being Emma Stone is one of the main actresses!!! This movie made me fall in love with love all over again!! Looking forward to a sequel even though it doesn't need one because it's that good!
