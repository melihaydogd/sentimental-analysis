An accomplishment
This is one of those types of movies that doesn't try to be anything more than it's supposed to be. It's a cute movie, with great dancing, and great music. Put that together with some very good performances by the two leads, and you have a movie that not only accomplishes what it is trying to do - but excels at it.
