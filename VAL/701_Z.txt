its a try
Making a promising premise of an idea, that i laughed at at first glance, drown in a gurgling babble of dialouging..Its like walking on thin ice, stark naked and praying to god, will it carry me through this? well the music made for this film carries the spirits till the end of the tunnel of light, so theres hope for everyone if youre a believer...its a comedy take on religious moneymaking, where the smile and chime in getogethernes in the name of what you believe to be the higher source, in a win win opportunity to make quick money on a film franchise for true believers.if you love richard riehle celebrate his 404'ish or around that feature movies as an actor, elsewise i'm still sitting here like a bull waiting for a good movie made by opportunists on cristian moviemaking cause cristian movies dont need to be good, because they are bad, and so is this one too.but if you like b.acting on a c-scale with wind and wuthering in your sole, please be my guest, because im old and grumpy , therefore just a 5, a small recommend
