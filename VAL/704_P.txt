Worth Watching
If you can get past the first couple of episodes of Season 1, it WILL get better. Like most shows, the first season is used to build the storyline, introduce characters & so forth. It is definitely worth giving it a shot!! I am a little disappointed that Season 5 is being released an episode a week (after the first 3 episodes), but it gives you something to look forward to each week. Now, I'm highly disappointed that after Amazon picked it up, once SyFy canceled, that Season 6 will be the last season, but nevertheless...a fantastic show to get into!!
