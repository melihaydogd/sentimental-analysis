Philosophically bankrupt at best and dull at worst
It seems Hollywood is out of villains to attack so now it's gone after Capitalism. Sure, Hollywood has attacked Capitalism before but now with the Occupy movement and socialism on the public consciousness it has become the "in" thing to stand on the opposite side of the driving economic force that built America and scream "how dare you."

It's also painfully obvious that the occupiers of Hollywood can't tell the difference between Crony Capitalism and laissez-faire Capitalism.

"Cosmopolis" wants to drive one point home: successful business people are emotional corrupt, bored with life, and evil.

The premises of the argument within "Cosmopolis" is that in order to achieve you have destroy. You have to climb up the ladder off the back of the "little man" and once your up the ladder it's not enough that you made the climb but you have to gloat about it.

This is why "Cosmpolis" is philosophically bankrupt. It doesn't draw a distinction between the criminal behavior of people that have made their fortune by destroying others on their way, and the people that have made their fortune by trading value for value.

Strip away the criminal behavior that is Crony Capitalism and you have the dollar as a representation of value. We trade value for value. My job pays me X amount of dollars to apply my skill set to their company for X amount of hours a day. I then use that money (my time/my life) to buy the essentials (i.e. food, vehicle, home) of my choice. If I enter into an arrangement with someone to buy goods from them I trade the money I have earned from my time spent at my job for this person's goods that has a similar value to them. We trade value for value. When force enters the equation we no longer trade value for value. Force is coercion, lies, black-mail, etc.

This is the problem with "Cosmpolis." Its characters act like princes or trust fund kids. They act as if they've obtained their wealth by no effort of their own. They act like they've no concept of Value.

"Cosmopolis" has a cast of characters that are wooden caricatures of what the 99% think is holding them down.

It's fantasy with a flawed premises. It's philosophically bankrupt at its very best and its painfully dull at its very worst.
