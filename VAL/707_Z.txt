Not sure what the fuss is about
Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that.

Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.

Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same.
