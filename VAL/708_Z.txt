A for Sarcasm
I thought this film was absolutely hilarious. And I'm not just saying that because it has literary ties and 80s movies references sprinkled throughout.

Olive has a bad reputation, but it's not really true. She's trying to do the right thing, and like everything else, it's spun out of control. Instead of trying to be honest with people about her actions, Olive chooses to roll with her new image and go all Hester Prynne on High School. She looses sight of why she said what she did to start with and actually believes what people say about her.

The best thing about this film is the excellent sarcastic nature and dialogue that it possesses. Olive is played by Emma Stone who has like the best attitude and sense of humor ever. If Olive were real everyone would want to be her best friend, rather than ostracize her. Her humor comes honestly, because her parents are like the coolest people ever. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are absolutely amazing as Olive's parents. Though the "bad guy" is really just Olive's reputation and rumor, Amanda Bynes plays the good Christian girl to perfection. Sometimes irony is the best form of comedy.

I like it. So you will like it. I promise. Unless you don't enjoy laughing or fun films which show the hypocrisy of our society. Then you won't like it.
