Earth to Echo...echo......echo.........echo............echo.
Loved it. I wish I could leave the review at that. It can't be classified as found footage. It's more of a home movie which is a good sign that some people are looking at the genre and finding ways of putting actual creativity into it.

It was reminiscent of E.T., and just like the film that touched my childhood imagination, this film did so to my adult imagination. The titular character Echo was cute and had nuances that reverberated with me long after watching it.

You could call it a modern day remake of E.T., but just because it has similarities in theme and plot elements doesn't make it so. Echo has a life of its own, and out of the 60 movies I have watched in 2015 thus far (May the 6th), this one has come out in the top five and doesn't look like budging.
