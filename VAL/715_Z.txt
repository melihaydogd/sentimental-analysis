The views are beautiful and the director pay attention to every details. It is a pleasure. However after spending nearly 3 hours watching this film, I could not tell any meaningful things from this movie. This is a story about a person's normal life except this person is getting younger not getting older. Maybe the director want us to let things go when they become out of control. We need to face them and accept them peacefully. What is more, I really don't like Brad Pitt, how little acting skill he has.

Anyway, this is neither a good or bad movie. I expected something more before watching this.
