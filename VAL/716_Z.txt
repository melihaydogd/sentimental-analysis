I appreciate the nostalgia of the film.
I watched this film in A-Level Media Studies because we were studying the Sci-Fi genre. Metropolis (1927) is where the Sci-Fi genre really begins.

At the time, Metropolis was the most expensive silent film ever made and its clear to see why. It was clearly well ahead of its time with visionary ideas.

The special effects were amazing for there time, but are now obviously very dated.

The problem is that the film was quite boring after a while and I only recommend to watch for nostalgic reasons, rather than for excitement and entertainment.
