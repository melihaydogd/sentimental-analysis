it does have its moments
Well I was not really of thinking seeing this film but a friend told me it was a good movie I went to see it with some friends its not the greatest live action movie I have seen but it does have some good moments. The story is about Yogi bear and his friend trying to get people's food at the park and always end up getting into trouble like they do in the cartoon I have not seen the cartoon before I hope its any better because this movie was a bit disappointing film but all Theo Tom Cavanagh had saved this film not a lot but he save some of it this is probably an underrated film but its an okay movie thats it I think IMDb was a bit harsh on this film because some of the moments give a lot of the time to think its an okay movie and to me its an okay kids movie because it was quit silly and a bit disappointing but okay This movie is probably an okay movie for kids but don't expect any thing great an okay it does have its moments I give it a 5 out of 10 okay.
