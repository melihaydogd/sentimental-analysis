Wow this movie as so good. I mean Jennifer Garner is the best actress ever to play Elektra. Man you got to see that movie, it rocked,I mean the fighting scene are just genius and I can't believe they did it with real weapon. The story was so great, with Abbe trying to do like Elektra such fun. Plus the guy was cute, I expected something really boring since people seems to think it was boring and not cool at all, but it was better than daredevil and I really do hope they will be another Elecktra, because this one was so so so so so so SO SO so so good you got to see that movie :d Elecktra outfit is way better than in the previous movie. And the way she use sarcasm and the old man omg he's so philoshophic with everyone. Though I didn't like Elecktra kissed another guy than Daredevil ....:( But in the DVD , in the deleted scene we see Ben Affleck/Daredevil coming back for Elecktra
