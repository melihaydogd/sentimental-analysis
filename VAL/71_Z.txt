Unexpected rollercoaster.
Not the sort of movie you'd expect to be described as a rollercoaster, but that's the best way to describe my emotions watching it.

Ryan and Emma are clearly talented actors, but I'm not sure they were so well cast for this. Beautiful to see singers not doing the usual screech thing that they all do these days, but still, I didn't feel they were strong enough for this.

I must say, talking of sound quality, the sound on this production is awful. Absolutely awful. I own a top spec TV and no matter how I adjusted the settings parts of the dialogue are completely inaudible. I almost went with subtitles.

Hollywood, and everyone else please stop allowing actors to mumble their lines, how can anyone think that's ever going to be good for the industry!?

There were parts of this movie that forced me to love it, I had no choice. Especially where I was suprised with the ability of both actors. Then suddenly I was cringing at other parts.

There were parts where I was glued to the screen, others where I started nodding off.

Overall, at the end of the rollercoaster, I was confused. Why. Why was this movie made? What was it for? Was it retro? Was it modern? Was it comedy? Was it drama? Was it fantasy?

I'm far from being an expert on musicals. Moulin Rouge I enjoyed. It was clear from the start what it was and it did it well. A star is born... Is that a musical? I dunno but it was good, it had a style, it gripped me. This? La la? I'm just not sure what I've just watched. And I definitely have no clue what the people making it had in mind. It changed direction and style so often it was as if different segments had different crew members making it.

It gets a 5. Something kept me going, I just don't know what.
