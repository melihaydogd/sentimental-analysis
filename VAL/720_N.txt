Crap
In 1990's we had several crap films

This is one of the films where Govinda takes a break from his non stop comedies and does an action film though they is a comic role too for him

The film is another double role by Govinda One is a serious cop and the other is a Rajnikant fan who copies him

The film is a typical action film with lot of nonsense like the entire climax where the goons make funny sounds when get hit Even the way Govinda kills the villain is hilarious

There are several more stupid scenes

Direction is awful Music is bad

Govinda does well in the cop role and does well in the Rajnikant take off role too but overacts Madhoo and Shilpa are as usual Amongst rest Shakti Kapoor and all the goons including Ishrat Ali do their routine
