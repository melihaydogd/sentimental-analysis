Animated movie of the year winner!
9/10.
Miles, the main character portrays it's role so wonderfully. Honestly, the one thing I think holds the anime genre back sometimes is the storyline but this one does so fantastically you'll be hooked within the starting stretches. Funnily, the movie is filled with introduction's of all the spider-creatures which is a bit repitatve but safe to say necessary for the storyline. This good animated movies don't come much offen. So what are you waiting for? Grab some popcorns and take a leap of faith!
