Aside from any morality issues, this is just a really bad movie
Looking through the reviews of this film, it seems some people give it a bad score because they disapprove of the subject matter, but it doesn't look like anyone just gives it a bad score purely as cinema. So let me be the first.Sometimes you know a movie is going to be bad from the first 15 seconds, and this is one of these films. Beginning with a long, artsy shot combined with a tedious minimalist modernist score, the film tries to scream IMPORTANT and succeeds in screaming PRETENTIOUS. The movie then plays interviews over recreations of scenes, those recreations being tedious and uninteresting.The movie also doesn't begin by telling you what it's about. I'm not sure when it does get around to that, because after a few minutes I knew there was no way I could get through this. I decided to fast forward and see if the movie ever got anywhere, and I kind of get the impression that by the halfway point they were still talking around what happened. I could be wrong, since it would be insane to do that (especially since most people watching would have some idea of the subject matter), but anytime I slowed down and took a look it was just more tedious, banal talk about nothing in particularly over arty cinematography.This seems less of a documentary than of a musing upon a subject.Normally if I've only watched five minutes of a movie I don't rate it, because I think it's unfair to effect the movie's overall rating if I don't know what I'm talking about. But I'm making an exception for this one, because it's pretentious student film maker approach is just too utterly agonizing to give a pass to.Why is no one else saying this? The only review I saw that took the filmmaker to task for any of the bad film-making mainly was a lunatic diatribe against "liberals" and "homosexuals." Horrible movie. I can't believe it's got such a high rating.
