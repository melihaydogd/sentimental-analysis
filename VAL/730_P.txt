Sensitive and Delicate
Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a small room in a shed without windows and with only a skylight on the roof. When Joy has encounters with a man, Jack locks himself in a closet. When Jack is five years old, Joy tells him that she lived with her parents in a comfortable house and a man called Old Nick lured and kidnapped her seven years ago. Joy plots a scheme to let Jack flee from the room and call the police. When they are rescued, they move to the house of Joy&#39;s mother and they have to begin the adaptation to the routine of a normal life. But is it not easy.<br/><br/>&quot;Room&quot; is a sensitive and delicate film with a dramatic and realistic story of woman and child abuse and the effects in the aftermath. The screenplay is very well written increasing tension without the use of cheap means such as graphic violence, sex and gore but only subtle dialogues. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay have awesome performances, showing also fantastic chemistry, and with magnificent supporting cast including names such as Joan Allen and William H. Macy. In the end, &quot;Room&quot; is an unforgettable and unique film that touches the viewer&#39;s heart. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): &quot;O Quarto de Jack&quot; (&quot;The Room of Jack&quot;)
