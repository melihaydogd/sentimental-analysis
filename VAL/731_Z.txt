Well, it had style...
I don't know. I absolutely loved the look of the movie, but found the plot lacking. I felt this movie could have been called "Death Wish 2000". I swear, if there was any justice in this world , Charles Bronson would have had a stupid cameo in this movie. Film consists of a murdered rock musician coming back to avenge his death and his girlfriend's assault. Watch him kill one of the guys who had attacked him. Then watch him kill another. And another. See him rip a cheesy guitar solo from atop an apartment building. But again, at least this movie had great set designs, unlike the Death Wish movies which had almost nothing going for them.
