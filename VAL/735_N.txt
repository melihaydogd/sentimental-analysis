One of the worst movies ever
I love to bring up this movie in casual conversation. Someone says "That was a pretty good movie" but after I point out 2 or 3 things they usually admit that it not a good movie in any way.

The plot has holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through - soldiers who died in a declared war had their deaths covered up? Why? Everyone in the world knew here they were and what they were doing.A man is kept in prison for 30 years with no charges and no convictions and no one notices? A dozen men can steal a dozen weapons of mass destruction (including missiles) in 10 minutes with dart guns? SEALs can't figure out how to open a locked door?

You get the idea. I can't get through 3 minutes of this movie without shaking my head in disgust.
