Bilge
What an awful collection of clich√©s and bilge this is. The characters (using the term loosely) are hysterical and each in possession of several tics of personality. They don't interact, they merely display their own idiosyncrasies with no reference to anyone else. It really is that bad.

Like most American films involving the military, there is virtually no indication of any professionalism at all. People lose tempers, shout, go ballistic for no reason and play the maverick which is either the true state of the American military or the Hollywood take.

While Sean Connery is competent here, Nicholas Cage is most deservedly not. Perhaps in an attempt to keep up with Connery's professionalism as an actor, Cage shouts all the time and overacts terribly in every scene the two share. The result is Cage looks like an amateur.

Don't bother to watch this.
