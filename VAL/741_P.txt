90 Min Ride with lots of great moments!
Finally got to see some amazing movie in the cinema. To be honest this film is filled with lots of terrific moments and surprises (not twists) with its badass characters, especially the protagonist "Bob Odenkirk" he completely nailed it.

From the start to the end of the film was a BANG! ... for all those who love movies like John Wick, Equalizer shouldn't miss this movie at all ... It worth the money
