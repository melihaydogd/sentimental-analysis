One of Pacino's "low end" movies. Pacino himself played a pretty decent role, among him other actors did also a decent job with the movie. It is just that the plot was not great at all, in fact it was very disappointing. The movie contained too many lengthy scenes where nothing happened and the over all suspense area of the movie was very dull. Overall it was a pretty bad movie.
