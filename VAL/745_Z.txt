Amazing 30 minutes movie
The first 30 minutes (at Omaha beach) is absolutely a knock-out!  Incredible realistic scenes! Masterpiece direction by Spielberg! But the rest of the movie is just like any Spielberg film : old stuff with a new feeling. We saw that kind of story a thousand times: Attack (1956) Red Badge of courage (1951) Walk in the sun (1946) All quiet on the western front (1930) There's also a 1919 Universal war movie, Heart of humanity, telling the story of a mother who lost all his sons in World War I, except one... But the Omaha Beach is absolutely amazing! The rest is just Hollywood entertainment.
