The most disappointing movie ever. Why:
I have never seen Leonardo DiCaprio in any below-the-average movie so I had high expectations watching it. What a shock! The most boring movie I can remember having watched. How can it have 8,2 rating with so many negative reviews? It should have been between 4,5 and 5,5 stars without any doubts.How can people be excited about it? Seriously, I have never written any reviews ever before all these years I have this account in IMDb but l just couldn't stand it. I had to say it and warn others. It was that disappointing.

Boring plot, scenario inexistent, too much violence and that ridiculous scene with the bear... all mixed with a direction the cherry on the top of the cake. A direction that could even make someone who just got an ecstasy pill to fall asleep after few minutes.

Don't waste your money like most people say here.
