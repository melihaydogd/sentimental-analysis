Garbage
Worst movie I've ever watched. Boring. Confusing. Stupid. Weird. Abstract. It doesn't explain anything. An explanation of something, ANYTHING was the ONLY reason I FORCED myself to sit through the whole thing. Nothing. It doesn't explain who or what she is. Where she came from. Why she's here. Her purpose for doing what she's doing. Who is the guy on the motorcycle? What's their connection? The movie description is the most explanation you'll get. I can't believe Scarlett Johansson would want her name attached to this thing. Biggest waste of talent I've ever seen. If you like off the wall, abstract stuff you'll love it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.
