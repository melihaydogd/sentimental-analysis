Appeal to Emotion (a bit too much)
At the first 20 minutes of the movie you are in a roller coaster of emotions. You get emotional, you may even cry. The problem is after 40 minutes you are so over the whole roller coaster. After a while you are just tired with the way the movie keeps trying to appeal to you emotion, it's quite annoying. I'm not even going to attempt to write a critic for the ending 'cause it's so far reached that Nasa's Voyager 1 whould be jealous. I have a feeling the scenario worked better with the original korean version. Did i like the cinematography? Yes. Do i believe Aras Bulut Iynemli is an amazing actor? YES. Did i appreciate the work the director make? Of course Not impressed though. If you want to watch a movie about a father with special needs watch I am Sam (2001) and if you want to see a movie about a person being jailed in Turkey watch Midnight Express (1978). I would recommend only for the amazing performance of Aras and the fabulous cinematography and that's it.
