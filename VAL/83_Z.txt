You'd let both of us die just to keep your secret?
This time the Razzie's got it wrong. This movie was no where near as bad as made out to be and was, in fact, a fascinating movie.

Let's get the major complaint out of the way first, as I happen to agree with it.

If you are going to take a role that calls for you to be a stripper, then you damn well better be willing to strip. The fact that Lohan wasn't really detracted from the film. There that's it. She was the wrong choice for the role.

But, she really did a credible job playing Dakota Moss and being Aubrey was just a natural for her. I really enjoyed her performance and could totally see her as this girl with a terrible childhood.

The movie was also well written as a neo-noirish mystery that had some clues, but also did not make sense. How could she be the same person? How could she not be Aubrey? When the secret is revealed, it should come as a surprise. It did for me.

This film was enjoyable, and if Lohan ever decides to play a role for real, then she may gain some credibility.
