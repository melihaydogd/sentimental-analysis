A melody of a film.
The first thing that strikes you is the haunting back-ground melody of A.R. Rahman which repeats itself with the fabric falling from the sky, and the beauty of the period that is well photographed. This movie reminds me of Merchant-Ivory production with all blossoming English Countryside. Shyam Benegal is an ace director who has produced some classic Art-House films and "Zubeida "is one of them. Amrish Puri is his usual talented self. Karisma Kapoor has given her trademark acting but she will never reach the intensity of acting as in "Rishtey". Manoj Bajpai is a good actor who does justice to any character he plays. This is a movie that leaves you the feeling that you have just read beautiful poetry and you want to read it over and over again.
