Waste of time
Where to start? This is a bad film from start to finish. 1. The acting is really bad. Almost everyone is overacting. Almost every character is a bad stereotype: The scummy cop, the over the top mob gangster, the white trash single mother, the bratty child that doesn't want any help, etc. Lastly, the southern accents are just plain terrible. They are just pure clich√© and add to the terrible overacting.

2. The plot is completely nonsensical. Why do the Police AND the FBI, who are clearly eager for information about the whereabouts of the body of the senator, intimidate a 11 y.o. boy by giving him the feeling he commited a crime? This whole situation could've been resolved by a sensible prosecutor: Ask for the information and offer witness protection. Case closed. The mob gangsters would never have had the time to react in time. They could've just arrested the Blade guy. But nah, the Tommy Lee Jones Character rather takes his time to punish a kid instead of resolving the senator case.

All in all: A waste of time. I could've done something better in those 2 hours.
