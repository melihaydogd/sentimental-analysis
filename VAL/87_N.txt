I am stunned by other's comments,this movie was boring
well I must say I was disappointed.we were waiting very much this movie since cannes,and when you walk out of the theater,your reaction is:it was just that??this movie has visual beauty for sure but it was without soul,lacks point of view.it's not a bad film just a not solved film. the acting:well for those who wanted oscars,forget it immediately the technical aspect:only art direction and score were not bad. Wladyslaw Spillman must be turning in his grave!
