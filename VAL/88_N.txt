Promising, but poor script and lack of action makes it disappointing
After the events of Zombie Massacre (2013), you would imagine that this film would be a sequel. You are mistaken. This film is not even a prequel.Zombie Massacre 2: Reich of the Dead (2015) details an independent story set in WWII. A small group of American soldiers finds shelter in an apparently abandoned building as they try to call for help.We know that things are going to get worse. And the film does a good job of keeping the tension going. I was waiting for a zombie to appear at any moment, but the tension continued and continued. And continued. And continued ...When you get to the first zombie action, you've already watched a third of the movie. This is not bad, but the zombie encounter is disappointing. Disappointing enough that you label this movie "stalled." And you are correct: the film is really stalled.In the film's setting, I assume that "zombie knowledge" is not a common thing. Still, it seems that the story tries to explore the concept that a bite will turn you into a zombie, which I think doesn't make sense for the time portrayed in the film.The performance is acceptable, but it is still weak.The story as a whole does not present anything interesting. The ending tries to make everything mysterious and sinister, but I thought it was too confusing.I would not recommend this film to any ordinary viewer, just for fans of zombie movies.
