an absurd movie
The movie was fun through the first confrontation, which was on a bus. But I became suspicious because the hero was outnumbered 5-1. Then it got worse at the second home invasion, and ridiculous at the final confrontation. There might have been a third confrontation between the second home invasion and the final confrontation, but I forget. Oh, and there was a silly car chase. The hero's car is wallpapered with bullets, but he is unscathed.
