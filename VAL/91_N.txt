An embarrassment
This is not a spoiler. There is nothing to spoil. I have rarely given a film such a low score, and I am one who enjoys the subject of space travel and good sci-fi. I am shaken that any part of this film was nominated for an Oscar. I am disappointed at the high score of readers on IMDb - - in my mind, it creates a cloud on all future high ratings. By any measure, except special effects (even those are not that spectacular), this film is a failure. If you enjoy watching things fly around and Sandra Bullock grunt and gasp for an hour and a half, by all means watch it. Dialogue, what little there is, is insipid. Plot is preposterous. I can only imagine NASA workers laughing and rolling their eyes. Anyone seriously interested in the craft of filmmaking, take my advice: Don't waste 90 minutes of your life. You can't say you weren't warned.
