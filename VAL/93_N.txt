The Worst!
Quite possibly the worst Marvel Movie of all time. Yet another movie that baffles me with the high praises surrounding it.

The story line is nothing but depressing. No part of the information that is being offered explains why Logan would end up in that living situation or where all the already existing mutants are while this is happening. The plot is full of logic holes and too much of it simply doesn't make any sense. I have no idea why this movie was made.
