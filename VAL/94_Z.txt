Medicore, or I'm just dumb.
Sunset boulevard was a 'good' movie. This isn't a lazy observation or a lazy review. It was 'good'. The space between a mediocre film and a great film. It's story was intriguing but was dragged on. The lines were delivered well, but the writing itself was mediocre.
Sunset boulevard, being one of the most famous black and white films, was a bit of a disappointment for me. It felt like a normal film to me. It didn't stand up to what I heard about it. It's was just... a movie. Maybe there was a deeper underlying tone that I didn't understand due to my simple knowledge of films, but I felt nothing still. The characters were intriguing, especially the two women, but the main character itself was viewed (by me) as a normal man. Maybe that was the cool part of him. I do not know.
I feel like this movie had something greater under its face. If I'm too dumb to understand it, I'm the dumb one. But for a normal guy like me, this was nothing but a normal old film.
