Flat
Let's see, where to start...this is a movie based on a bad cartoon. It's flat, to be frank. A pointless, phoned-in plot, and hideous visual effects. Dan Akroyd tries to pay tribute to the original voice for Yogi- Bear, but ultimately comes off as annoying and voice acting with little substance. I tried to watch this movie from a kid's point of view, but even then I felt the filmmakers were disrespecting me by making me watch the same story and dialog I've seen a hundred times before. Trust me, I could've written a better script. This film doesn't know its audience, and therefor spreads its humor too thin. Wait a minute, what humor? Tired themes of corporate greed and the lovable loser trying to get the girl are done and are so boring. This review doesn't contain spoilers, because the plot is so predictable, everyone can see the 'spoilers' coming from a mile away.
