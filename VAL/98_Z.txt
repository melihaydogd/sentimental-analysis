All The Best Bits Were In The Trailer !!!
I'm going to make this short, the movie drags on a lot.

Script is pretty dull, special effects weren't as good as promised, acting was okay - Dev Patel stood out as the best casting decision.

My problem is that I could never get into the mystics of this story, having never watched the animated cartoon series it was half boring/half nerdy.

There is a hot princess which was good eye candy for the time being but honestly; Mr. Shyamalan really dropped the ball on this.

With his newest picture "Devil" coming out I don't have high hopes for this director's success anymore!
