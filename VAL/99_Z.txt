Great idea, terrible execution.
I have no problem with a heist movie featuring an all-female cast, but this was just terribly done. I didn't believe any of the eight were actually good at their jobs. Unlike the original movies, they didn't bother spending time to make you believe. The plot was super loose and felt randomly thrown together. There were also just too many celebrity cameos and they take you out of the movie. It was an amusing movie, but I wouldn't waste any money on it. Wait a few years to catch reruns on cable.
