Depressing - from start to finish
Reading all the glowing reviews here, I'm wondering if we've all watched the same film, or if I've slipped into a parallel universe in which this movie is actually great or if I'm just an alien from another planet with very different tastes. Honestly, this must be one of the worst films I've seen.

Anyway, this is what I didn't like about this film -

1) Mindless, over-the-top violence; gruesome, macabre fight scenes, even including the scenes featuring children.

2) Excessive swearing which seemed both forced and out of character.

3) Terrible portrayal of two of the most loved characters in the X-men universe. I can see reviewers wax lyrical about how this was a great send-off for these characters. You must be joking. Iron Man's death in Avengers Endgame was a fitting send-off, not this rubbish.

4) Poor dialogue writing. I can't recall a single noteworthy dialogue in the entire movie. Some people have compared this movie to Deadpool. Well, at least Deadpool had its fair share of wit and humour, this movie is just sad and depressing throughout.

5) There is a recurring theme in the movie that whoever is good to someone else or tries to help someone else ends up dead, in the most brutal manner possible. So whether it is Caliban, Gabriela, the Munsons, Professor X or Wolverine, they all pay a heavy price for just being good. Great way to subconsciously put the idea in people's heads that just being nice is going to backfire in a big way.

It's both surprising and sad to see a movie like this, with all the violence, gloomy themes, bad writing and negative energy being rated 8+ by viewers. Maybe its just a reflection of the kind of society we live in these days.
